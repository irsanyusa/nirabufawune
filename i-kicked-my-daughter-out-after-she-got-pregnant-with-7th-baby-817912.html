But her daughter’s irresponsible actions and neglect towards her own children made the mom reconsider and step&nbsp;up. Let’s discover what unfolded.</p><p><h2>Here is&nbsp;her story.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/559/2f2/fae04250c2b1222c18c0417e99.jpg><p>«I&nbsp;(45F) have a&nbsp;27-year-old daughter. She has 6&nbsp;kids, between the ages of&nbsp;10–11&nbsp;months. There are 3&nbsp;different fathers. She receives child support from 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them, and she is&nbsp;still with the 3rd one, and they have been for 5&nbsp;years. My&nbsp;daughter works part-time, and her fiancé is&nbsp;a&nbsp;chef full-time.</p><p>They have lived with&nbsp;us for the past year and a&nbsp;half, due to&nbsp;getting evicted from their last home. The kids and they have our upstairs bedrooms (there are&nbsp;2) but that’s still crowded for 6&nbsp;children. They are constantly asking me&nbsp;for help with phone bills. My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I have asked for no&nbsp;rent so&nbsp;they’d be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;save money to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;home, which I&nbsp;do not believe they were doing.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/104/21d/ad552a5523a1bcbf6a2154328a.jpg><p>«I&nbsp;have put up&nbsp;with loud voices throughout all hours, and waking up&nbsp;at&nbsp;different hours to&nbsp;cater to&nbsp;children because&nbsp;I love my&nbsp;grandchildren. I&nbsp;never complained to&nbsp;my&nbsp;daughter because&nbsp;I believe <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> is&nbsp;very important. It’s just that my&nbsp;children are all grown&nbsp;up, my&nbsp;youngest moved out 4&nbsp;years ago and my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I had hopes to&nbsp;remodel. We&nbsp;didn’t expect them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;living here this long.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/059/6a5/cf0ebe50a49fe9498355fe1e51.jpg><p>«On&nbsp;Christmas Eve, my&nbsp;daughter gathered&nbsp;us all around and announced they were pregnant with baby #7. Everyone was all excited, but&nbsp;I felt dread. That would mean another child in&nbsp;our house with not much room. I&nbsp;looked over at&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband and could tell he&nbsp;felt the same, we&nbsp;discussed it&nbsp;later and decided we&nbsp;were going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;ask them to&nbsp;move out.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cde/bb0/290df755adb895df42667419f2.jpg><p>«Last night at&nbsp;dinner&nbsp;I brought it&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;daughter and her boyfriend, and we&nbsp;told them, they have 2&nbsp;months to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;place because we&nbsp;cannot have another child here. My&nbsp;daughter started crying, saying she couldn’t believe I’d throw her to&nbsp;the streets for having a&nbsp;baby, that this was completely unfair and not enough time. I&nbsp;told her&nbsp;I was sorry, it&nbsp;was painful for me&nbsp;as&nbsp;well, but these living conditioners were impossible.</p><p>She demanded&nbsp;I give her more time, or&nbsp;she’d go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the courts, and&nbsp;I told her news flash, the courts only give you 30&nbsp;days. She then said my&nbsp;grandchildren were going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;homeless because&nbsp;I was selfish. She made a&nbsp;Facebook post where she asked for rooms to&nbsp;rent because «she’s pregnant and has nowhere to&nbsp;go, and her family didn’t care about her.»</p><p><h2>On&nbsp;the internet, some folks chimed in&nbsp;with their thoughts on&nbsp;this situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/123/bbd/7b577b504591a3848d74b63c66.jpg><p>had ze jaren eerder eruit moetengooien!</p><ul><li>Continuing to&nbsp;have children is&nbsp;a&nbsp;choice they have made. You and your spouse get a&nbsp;choice in&nbsp;who stays in&nbsp;YOUR home.<br>Your daughter is&nbsp;EXTREMELY selfish to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;bring children into the world without being established enough to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;them on&nbsp;a&nbsp;support system that she has built. She did not ask that of&nbsp;you and just simply assumed that because you were willing to&nbsp;support her family at&nbsp;the large quantity they were. She thought, «Eh, what’s one more? The more the merrier.»<br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ladyofmodernity&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>If&nbsp;anyone is&nbsp;selfish here, it’s your daughter. Who in&nbsp;their right mind has that many children with no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;feed and house them without help?<br>I&nbsp;am sorry for you and hope you can remain strong. Start by&nbsp;steering your daughter and Baby Daddy #3 to&nbsp;Social Services to&nbsp;see what resources are available to&nbsp;them because the parental ATM should have closed a&nbsp;long time ago. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>BunnySlayer64&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/76b/8fa/c7c0f5593a907f55c6850f3ebc.jpg><ul><li>She has been and continues to&nbsp;be&nbsp;irresponsible. She should be&nbsp;getting a&nbsp;pretty decent income tax check for all those kids, and they should qualify for financial aid with that many kids. Give them until May at&nbsp;the latest. They should have income tax money by&nbsp;then and they can use that to&nbsp;put down for rent and help get them set&nbsp;up. She can look on&nbsp;Facebook Marketplace for low-cost and free furniture. If&nbsp;you decide to&nbsp;keep them around longer, charge rent and put it&nbsp;into savings until there is&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;send them on&nbsp;their way. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>CharmingChaos33&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>She is&nbsp;of&nbsp;legal age and the fact that she felt it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;appropriate time to&nbsp;get pregnant shows how little respect she has.

As&nbsp;long as&nbsp;you enable her, she will keep using you to&nbsp;avoid her responsibilities. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;sad, but&nbsp;I think you can help her better from a&nbsp;distance. If&nbsp;you can help with child care so&nbsp;that she can work, you would still get some time to&nbsp;recharge when your house is&nbsp;quiet.<br>Just give her a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;ways that you are willing to&nbsp;help, but housing them is&nbsp;not one of&nbsp;them. That will be&nbsp;7&nbsp;kids under 11&nbsp;— without stability.
