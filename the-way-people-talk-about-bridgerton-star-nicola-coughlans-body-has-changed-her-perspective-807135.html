As&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress, Nicola Coughlan’s body is&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift, and she can use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;play many incredible women in&nbsp;her line of&nbsp;work. However, she just wishes to&nbsp;be&nbsp;known as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress instead of&nbsp;someone who is&nbsp;accepted for a&nbsp;role based on&nbsp;weight only. “The prism through which my&nbsp;body is&nbsp;viewed is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>inescapable</a>.”</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> want to&nbsp;share the story of&nbsp;this sweet actress’s perspective on&nbsp;people’s opinions of&nbsp;her body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3be/881/e0553a5031b115b3cffdd547ee.jpg><p>Nicola Coughlan first encountered these remarks when she auditioned for a&nbsp;play called <i>The Prime of&nbsp;Miss Jean Brodie</i>. She had spent 7&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>weeks</a> preparing for the role, complete with many hours perfecting her accent and researching the history precisely in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;put herself in&nbsp;the ideal world of&nbsp;this character, Joyce Emily&nbsp;— a&nbsp;fascinating, rich girl that no&nbsp;one could manage.</p><p>Coughlan spent so&nbsp;much time working on&nbsp;this character only to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;very unkind review that was centered around her appearance. These words about how she looked were so&nbsp;irrelevant, because there was no&nbsp;description of&nbsp;the character’s weight or&nbsp;size. Even though she can take these kinds of&nbsp;comments well, she felt very belittled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa9/e8b/3eb3225ae8ab07f3dce0fe118f.jpg><p>Not only does this occur with celebrities, but it&nbsp;happens in&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> gatherings as&nbsp;well. If&nbsp;you have ever been at&nbsp;a&nbsp;dinner with your family, and they mentioned your size once or&nbsp;twice, then you probably know how Coughlan feels.</p><p>The actress uses her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>social</a> media accounts to&nbsp;openly talk with all her fans. She recently shared that she understands people aren’t trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rude or&nbsp;offensive, but she’s a&nbsp;human like everyone else, and it’s difficult to&nbsp;take in&nbsp;so&nbsp;many irrelevant comments. If&nbsp;losing weight was a&nbsp;requirement for a&nbsp;movie role, she wouldn’t have a&nbsp;problem with&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1a4/3c8/921464529da63e79ed3fbda629.jpg><p>People’s relationships with their bodies are very personal, and she believes she can do&nbsp;whatever she wants with hers. If&nbsp;becoming muscular and tanned was on&nbsp;her to-do list, she would pursue that, since it’s her own decision and no&nbsp;one else’s.</p><p>Coughlan is&nbsp;aware that she isn’t alone in&nbsp;this journey, and she follows the example of&nbsp;other people in&nbsp;the industry who are going through the same types of&nbsp;comments. “I&nbsp;hope in&nbsp;the future that more people will talk about our work, our inspirations, our drive, rather than our <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>looks</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9fd/8be/4471ea5cf0a5c0de3e6233bcbd.jpg><p>There are many different people who have things to&nbsp;say about the actress. Coughlan acknowledges the fact that people will have opinions and unpleasant things to&nbsp;say simply because she’s on&nbsp;TV. But she doesn’t sympathize with people sending these opinions to&nbsp;her direct messages on&nbsp;Instagram.</p><p>Coughlan also shared that she gets deeply uncomfortable and sad when interviewers ask her questions about her body instead of&nbsp;asking her about her passion for acting. “My&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>body</a> is&nbsp;the tool&nbsp;I use to&nbsp;tell stories, not what&nbsp;I define myself&nbsp;by.” People are truly too beautiful, courageous, and valuable to&nbsp;be&nbsp;seen only through their physical appearance, no&nbsp;matter who they are.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/245/293/673066537f9c40e570fbcf6bd8.jpg><p>Nicola is&nbsp;well known for playing Penelope in&nbsp;<i>Bridgerton</i>, and she’s currently working on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>season</a> 3&nbsp;with her wonderful crew. But she has also acted in&nbsp;the British <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sitcom</a>, <i>Derry Girls</i>, where she made a&nbsp;big impression on&nbsp;viewers as&nbsp;well and is&nbsp;finishing up&nbsp;with the final <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>season</a>.</p><p>Have you ever felt the same way as&nbsp;Nicola?
