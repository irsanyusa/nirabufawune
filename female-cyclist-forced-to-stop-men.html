competitors during a renowned bicycle race in Belgium was abruptly forced to stop for several minutes when she came too close to the “very slow” men’s race ahead of her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The cyclist, Nicole Hanselmann, described the “awkward moment” in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> after Saturday’s annual Omloop Het Nieuwsblad race, during which male cyclists were given an eight-minute head start.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As the race progressed, Hanselmann built a lead of almost two minutes against the other women cyclists and “almost saw the back of the men’s peloton.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“[Maybe] the other women and me were [too] fast or the men [too] slow,” she wrote in the Instagram post.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hanselmann, a 27-year-old cyclist and the 2017 national champion in Switzerland, said officials paused the women’s race to stop them from catching up to the men.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She said their race was halted for “five or seven minutes.” While she was given a head start to regain her lead when the race began again, Hanselmann <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Cyclingnews</a> that she lost her momentum when the race came to an abrupt stop, and her competitors <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">soon gained ground</a>. She ultimately finished in 74th place.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It was a bit sad for me because I was in a good mood and when the bunch sees you stopping, they just get a new motivation to catch you,” Hanselmann also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Cyclingnews</a>. “The race jury just said we had to neutralise the race because we are getting too close to the men.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a tweet on Saturday, race officials confirmed the “neutralisation” of the women’s race “due to a very slow [men’s] race” and then tweeted about five minutes later to announce the women’s race was restarting.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Neutralisation of our women race at railroad crossing in Sint-Denijs-Boekel in <a href=#>#OHNWomen</a> <a href=#>#ohn19</a> due to a very slow mens race. riders will restart with same timings</p>— Omloop Nieuwsblad (@OmloopHNB) <a href=#>March 2, 2019</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On social media, some said they wished officials had handled the situation differently.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hanselmann has now stopped completely, and gets a rather helpless "I'm sorry' from a race staff member.</p><p>Absolute nonsense, of course.<a href=#>#OHN19</a> <a href=#>#OHNwomen</a></p>— CyclingPub (@CyclingPub) <a href=#>March 2, 2019</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Either the men are slow. Or the women are just as good/fast/powerful as the men ? Which one is it ?</p><p>Either way, a halt in the race because Nicole Hanselmann was going too fast, is good but ridiculous.</p><p>Could you imagine a Men & Women <a href=#>#OHN19</a> field ? <a href=#>#safetyfirst</a> <a href=#>#OHNWomen</a></p>— Gina Ball (@GinaBally) <a href=#>March 2, 2019</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Flanders Classics, which oversees the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a statement</a> that officials needed to stop the women’s race briefly for “safety reasons.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“In normal conditions, the men ride faster than the women and the gap gradually increases. This year, however, the men were slower than usual in the beginning of the race, with a speed below 30km/h at times,” the statement said. “This circumstance caused a decreasing gap between the women’s and the men’s convoy. After 30 km, and for safety reasons, the organization had to intervene because the leader of the women’s race was getting too close to the convoy of the men’s race. At that point the elite women’s race was neutralized for about 5 minutes time. As soon as the safety was restored the women were able to continue, with respect for the previous time differences obtained during the race.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Flanders Classics said that in the future, they would “consider letting the women’s race start a few minutes later than this year’s, to avoid any conflict between the men’s and women’s race.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWRpf3OEjp%2BcppmcmnqkxcKloKysXZu8s6%2FEnWStp12owbC8jKacp2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mikaela-shiffrin-2018-winter-olympics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Mikaela Shiffrin Became the Best Skier in the World</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ciara-jackie-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ciara 'Jackie' Review: The Singer Plays to Her Strengths</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
