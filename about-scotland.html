Even our cheese gives the French a run for their money!</p><h2>Scottish Produce</h2><p>Scotland’s stunning landscapes are more than just scenery – its coast and countryside are where our high-quality produce is reared, gathered and grown.</p><p>Hand-dived scallops, Aberdeen Angus beef, Ayrshire potatoes and the soft fruits of Fife are just some of the ingredients that Scottish chefs have to work with. Even seaweed, from <a href=#>Scotland’s seaweed farming sector</a> is finding a place on our dinner plates.</p><p>Local butchers and fishmongers, as well as farm shops, <a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>food festivals</a> and farmers markets, are great places to go to pick up tasty treats so you can cook up your own dishes.</p><p>Some Scottish produce is considered so unique that it’s been designated Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) by the European Union. These high-quality items must be produced in an agreed way and within a specific area to make use of the regional name.</p><p>So, when you taste products such as Stornoway Black Pudding, Traditional Ayrshire Dunlop cheese, Orkney Scottish Island Cheddar and Scottish Wild Salmon, you know it’s the real deal. And there’s nothing quite like eating them in the region they come from.</p><h2>Traditional Scottish food & drink</h2><p>Our traditional Scottish dishes are enjoyed by both locals and visitors. Scottish traditional dishes include desserts such as Cranachan, sweet treats like shortbread and tablet and savoury dishes, including Scotch broth and black pudding and of course, haggis.&nbsp;</p><p>Various regional cakes and snacks can be found across the country, including Aberdeenshire butteries, which is a type of bread roll, Dundee Cake and Cullen Skink – a deliciously creamy seafood soup.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Haggis dish surrounded by candles and glasses of wine" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scotland.org/images/uploads/general/ABOUT-places-eat-visitscotland_41489017159_1200px_1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>What is Scotland’s national dish?&nbsp;</h2><p>Scotland’s national dish is haggis, a savoury meat pudding, and it’s traditionally accompanied by mashed potatoes, turnips (known as ‘neeps’) and a whisky sauce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This brings us to the national drink – <a href=#>whisky</a>. Over 150 distilleries in Scotland produce this amber-hued liquid, many of which can be explored on a tour. &nbsp;</p><p>There are five Scottish whisky regions, each with their own distinct flavours, and rumour has it that if you don’t think you like whisky, it’s just because you haven’t found the right one yet!&nbsp;</p><p>Discover more about <a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>Scotch Whisky at VisitScotland&nbsp;</a></p><p>Discover more facts about <a aria-label="Open link to external website" class="link link--external" href=#>Scottish food and drink at VisitScotland</a></p><h2>Scottish drinks</h2><p>Want something to drink to wash down all the food?
