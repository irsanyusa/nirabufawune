And so, I feel comfortable. I feel bold enough to come to seek for your Royal Majesty's blessing.

There are some others that are distantly related, that are not exactly from the royal family that can also address themselves as children of the palace.</p><p>"When he (Akpata) said he's a child of the palace, he said it in English, I think he said it in Benin as well.

He's an industrious son of the soil. True indigenous son of the soil. But to say a child of the palace, I don't know whether any of them is a politician.

I said that 'he's our son.' That they should look after him and all. He doesn't have anything to do with the quarrel that's ongoing in Kaduna.
