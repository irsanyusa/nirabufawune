Catherine Parenteau, professional pickleball player and Skechers brand ambassador, explains that there are several important qualities to look for in pickleball shoes. “A quality pair of pickleball shoes should be comfortable, durable, lightweight, and allow you to focus on your game,” she says. As you shop for pickleball shoes, look for these qualities:</p><h3>Comfort</h3><p>When you’re spending many hours training and playing, you absolutely need a comfortable pair of shoes. Look for features like shock-absorbing materials in the sole and extra padding around the laces for extra comfort. Parenteau notes shoes with a relaxed fit offer plenty of space in the toe area, which can help to maximize comfort as you play.</p><h3>Support</h3><p>Shoes that provide you with the right amount of support will also be more comfortable. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hawley Lane Shoes</a> recommends looking for shoes that provide adequate arch support and ankle stability, which will not only improve your comfort, but which can help to prevent injuries.</p><h3>Durability</h3><p>Your pickleball shoes will see a lot of wear and tear. Look for shoes made of durable materials that are designed to last. Since many pickleball shoes can cost $100 or more, choosing a more durable shoe can help ensure you get maximum use out of your investment.</p><h3>Stability</h3><p>“I think it is important to choose a shoe that locks your foot into place so that you feel stable on the court,” says Parenteau. For example, shoes like the Skechers Viper Court Pro feature a rubber outsole to maximize stability and traction on the court.</p><h3>Sole design</h3><p>Pickleball Touring Professional and Director of Pickleball Instruction at Palmetto Dunes, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Sarah Ansboury</a>, explains that the outsole design plays an important role in how pickleball shoes perform. Pickleball players need to move in every direction, so look for court shoes, which can contribute to your safety and your overall performance. “Court shoes typically have a smooth sole,” she says. Avoid cross trainers, which have “nibs” that can stick to the court, potentially causing you to trip and fall.</p><h3>Fit</h3><p>It’s essential that your pickleball shoes fit you well. Some brands run narrower, and some brands offer wide sizes. Ansboury explains that your pickleball shoe size probably isn’t the same as your standard shoe size, so before you order shoes, it’s a good idea to go to a sports store where you can be fitted for a pickleball shoe.</p><h3>Weight</h3><p>Agility and quick movements are key to successfully playing pickleball, and heavy shoes can weigh you down. Look for shoes that are lightweight, yet still offer the stability you need during an intense game. While <a href=# rel=alternate>walking shoes</a> may feel comfortable, they may be too heavy for play—and while <a href=# rel=alternate>running shoes</a> may be lightweight, they may not offer the right stability.</p><h3>Breathability</h3><p>Hawley Lane Shoes recommends looking for shoes with a breathable design, which can help to keep you comfortable during hotter weather. Mesh and synthetic uppers can help to maximize airflow for a more breathable shoe.</p><h3>Style</h3><p>Finally, have some fun exploring different pickleball shoe styles and looks. As pickleball becomes even more popular, you’ll find shoes are available in more colors and styles. For the best results, look for shoes in colors that reflect the clothes colors you’ll most often wear on the court.</p><h2 id=how-to-maintain-and-clean-pickleball-shoes>How to maintain and clean pickleball shoes</h2><p>Ansboury notes that good socks are vital in caring for both your feet and your shoes. She encourages athletes who sweat heavily to change their socks multiple times throughout the day. Additionally, Ansboury doesn’t wear her pickleball shoes anywhere but on the court, which helps to minimize wear and tear.</p><p>Parenteau considers how easily a pair of shoes can be cleaned when selecting her shoes. “As a professional pickleball player, I wear the shoes more than the average player, so it is essential to find a pair you can easily throw into the washing machine,” she says.</p><p>To maintain your shoes, use a soft-bristled brush to remove loose dirt from the outsoles, taking out the laces and insoles, and surface cleaning pickleball shoes with a mix of mild laundry detergent or dish soap and warm water. You can also use shoe cleaners designed for the material your shoes are made of for a more thorough cleaning to get rid of stubborn stains. After cleaning, wipe the shoes with a damp cloth and let them air dry. Stuff them with newspaper to help absorb moisture while retaining their shape.</p><p>You can deodorize pickleball shoes by sprinkling baking soda inside the shoes or using a shoe deodorizer spray.</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-pickleball-shoes-for-women>How we selected the best pickleball shoes for women</h2><p>To choose the best pickleball shoes for women, I considered the features valued most by professional pickleball players. I looked for shoes with features designed to maximize comfort, such as shock absorbing materials, and also chose shoes that were designed to support athletes as they turned, accelerated, and stopped.</p><p>I also considered the materials used in each shoe’s construction and how they contribute to the shoe’s durability, breathability, and overall comfort. I tried to include shoes with soles designed to provide appropriate traction for various court surfaces. Finally, I considered the size availability of each shoe, as well as its overall style and appearance.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What type of shoe is best for pickleball?</h3><p>“You should invest in a pickleball-specific shoe,” recommends Parenteau. “I wear the Skechers Viper Court Pro shoe and it features all the necessary comfort and performance features you want in a pickleball shoe—superior comfort, enhanced traction and durability, and support. They look great, too.”</p><h3>What are the best court shoes for pickleball women?</h3><p>There is no one single best pair of court shoes for pickleball that will work for all women. Instead, look for shoes that feature a durable sole, have breathable construction, a supportive design, and a comfortable fit. The best shoes for you will partially depend on your foot shape, so you may need to try some different brands and models to tell which shoe works best.</p><h3>Are tennis shoes and pickleball shoes the same?</h3><p>Parenteau explains that there are some key differences between <a href=# rel=alternate>tennis shoes for women</a> and pickleball shoes. “I used to play tennis, and the footwear I wore then is different from what is appropriate for the pickleball court,” she says. “For pickleball, you need footwear that can accommodate side-to-side and forward movements. Compared to tennis, pickleball consists of quicker and shorter bursts of movement, so having a lighter weight shoe is something that is definitely beneficial,” she says.</p><h3>Can I use pickleball shoes for other sports?</h3><p>“You definitely can!” says Parenteau. “Personally, I always use my pickleball shoes for any off court training I do because my training involves much of the same movements I use in pickleball.”</p><h3>What are the best pickleball shoes for women with bunions?</h3><p>According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Bunion Institute</a>, bunions are bony protrusions at the base of the big toe. Whether you’re looking for pickleball shoes or running shoes for women, the best shoe for bunions will feature a wide toe box, good arch support, and a cushioned footbed to maximize your comfort. Choosing a wider pickleball shoe can help to avoid putting extra pressure on your toe joints, and breathable uppers allow shoes to flex and stretch to accommodate your foot shape.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1loJ6wrLjEm5ilpF2otbCxjJ%2Bmq2WnpLqmuo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-speak-faster-in-french.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Speak Faster in French - Lingoda</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./selma-alabama-free-paramount.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;Selma&amp;quot; To Screen for Free in Selma, Alabama</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
