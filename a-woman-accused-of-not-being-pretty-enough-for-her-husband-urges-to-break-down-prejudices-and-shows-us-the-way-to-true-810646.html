While she has amassed millions of&nbsp;followers, who admire and follow her adventures, she also receives criticism and hurtful comments about her relationship with her husband.</p><p>The content creator decided to&nbsp;speak out after a&nbsp;viral video garnered attention, according to&nbsp;her, for the wrong reasons. Alicia <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>posted</a> a&nbsp;transformation trend clip in&nbsp;which she and Scott are shown in&nbsp;towels and then fully dressed. The messages and comments that followed were cruel, with people, who didn’t know the couple at&nbsp;all, expressing their disbelief that Scott, who is&nbsp;physically fit, could be&nbsp;in&nbsp;love with a&nbsp;plus-size woman like Alicia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/78c/cf1/89ced5514bb25a9f2094ea9dfb.jpg><p>The Canadian woman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> some of&nbsp;the assumptions she has to&nbsp;deal with on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis: “’Oh, she was probably not fat when they met,’ or ’she must be&nbsp;rich,’ ’he must be&nbsp;gay,’ or ’he has a&nbsp;fetish for fat women.’ We&nbsp;have been led to&nbsp;believe that someone who is&nbsp;physically fit, like Scott, could never, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;million years, be&nbsp;in&nbsp;love or&nbsp;be&nbsp;compatible with a&nbsp;fat woman.”</p><p>Not many people know that Alicia and Scott have been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving relationship for 16&nbsp;years. They first fell in&nbsp;love while in&nbsp;school and have stuck together through various challenges, supporting and respecting each other, and celebrating the love that they have at&nbsp;every stage of&nbsp;their life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/386/a7d/b9c6185b40814e047d82c1d9f4.jpg><p>Alicia revealed that when she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lost</a> her job and was at&nbsp;a&nbsp;crossroads, it&nbsp;was her husband who provided the biggest support and encouragement for her to&nbsp;find herself and follow her dreams. That’s how the idea of&nbsp;posting funny videos of&nbsp;their life as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple came about. They wanted to&nbsp;show their moments of&nbsp;constant laughter and joy. Also, Scott wanted to&nbsp;share Alicia’s charming personality with the world, since he&nbsp;believed others would love her just as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;he&nbsp;does.</p><p>Choosing to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;content creator was a&nbsp;great decision for Alicia, leading to&nbsp;her gaining millions of&nbsp;followers. Through interacting with others, she has also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>learned</a> important lessons about self-esteem. The current social media star struggled with self-doubt and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that for a&nbsp;long time, she used to&nbsp;think like other people and would feel that she didn’t deserve Scott’s love: “I&nbsp;believed if&nbsp;I didn’t like myself, how could&nbsp;he?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ed/5cb/42912a564782f9c106524ab26e.jpg><p>Alicia <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>has acknowledged</a> that her insecurities and low self-esteem caused significant challenges in&nbsp;her marriage. However, through her journey of&nbsp;self-acceptance, she came to&nbsp;the realization that the way she saw herself was not at&nbsp;all the way that Scott saw her. One of&nbsp;her key pieces of&nbsp;advice is&nbsp;to&nbsp;stop making assumptions about our partners and to&nbsp;remember that they may see&nbsp;us differently than we&nbsp;see ourselves.</p><p>Alicia recognized that her husband’s love for her has never wavered, but what has changed is&nbsp;her own perspective, thus enabling him to&nbsp;love her the way he&nbsp;has always wanted.</p><p>This realization led her to&nbsp;start responding to&nbsp;the criticism and negativity they receive online by&nbsp;educating people about the harmful nature of&nbsp;false <a href=# title="beauty standards" data-link=tag>beauty standards</a> and the importance of&nbsp;recognizing the true value and worth of&nbsp;individuals. “The world looks at&nbsp;us and immediately gives more value to&nbsp;Scott than to&nbsp;me,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> the influencer.</p><p>She revealed that her husband had received messages from slim and conventionally attractive women suggesting that he&nbsp;should be&nbsp;with someone like them. “Me&nbsp;telling myself for most of&nbsp;our relationship that I&nbsp;am not worthy of&nbsp;his love due to&nbsp;my&nbsp;body is&nbsp;exactly the same as&nbsp;this thin woman telling him that she is&nbsp;worthy of&nbsp;him due to&nbsp;her body,” she emphasized.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c2/945/e3761f5becb2f0c24473843743.jpg><p>Alicia also mentioned that people often ask her if&nbsp;she feels jealous of&nbsp;the attention Scott receives. However, the influencer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stressed</a> that she feels secure in&nbsp;their love because she knows that her husband values her for her sense of&nbsp;humor, dedication, and kind heart&nbsp;— qualities that have nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with her appearance or&nbsp;weight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f1/016/f550a05913bbf548da62b6cc9a.jpg><p>you are a very pretty young lady don't let unhappy brake your life up you have a nice looking husband who not only has nice look but has the look of love in his eyes for you wishing you both a great long life together</p><p>Alicia <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>encourages</a> people to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;the inner qualities that truly define them, rather than solely on&nbsp;physical appearance. The influencer is&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;the fact that society places too much value on&nbsp;certain beauty standards, since they’ve been ingrained in&nbsp;us for a&nbsp;long time. However, she also insists that we&nbsp;can change that, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;everyone’s responsibility to&nbsp;break down prejudices.</p><p>Have you ever felt judged because of&nbsp;your choices or&nbsp;appearance?
