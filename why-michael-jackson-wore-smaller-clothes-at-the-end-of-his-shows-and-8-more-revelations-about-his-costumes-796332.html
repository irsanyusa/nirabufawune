That’s why his costumes had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;details that made everyone wonder why they were there and what they meant. For example, almost every jacket Michael Jackson wore had an&nbsp;armband on&nbsp;the right sleeve, and some of&nbsp;his jackets also had “777” sewn onto them.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> are fascinated with Michael Jackson`s wardrobe, and we`re ready to&nbsp;reveal some of&nbsp;the secrets behind his costumes!</p><p><h2>1. Why he&nbsp;wore smaller costumes at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;his shows</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/59a/122/a5a23359b4889549a85ad94f21.jpg><p>Michael Jackson`s dance routines were very physically strenuous, and he&nbsp;gave his all during his performances. By&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the show, he&nbsp;would often <a href=#>lose</a> up&nbsp;to&nbsp;5&nbsp;lbs, and his waist would become one inch thinner. And since it&nbsp;was important that his clothes fit perfectly, so&nbsp;that he&nbsp;could show off his dance moves, every next costume was a&nbsp;bit smaller than the previous one.</p><p><h2>2. How his lean shoes worked</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/427/456/5465f75bf0ac61761c2317aec8.jpg><p>Michael Jackson`s <a href=#>shoes</a> that helped him defy the laws of&nbsp;gravity had a&nbsp;V-shaped clasp at&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the heels. With its help, he&nbsp;could hook into a&nbsp;nail attached to&nbsp;the floor and perform his famous 45-degree forward tilt. However, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that and to&nbsp;keep his whole body straight, an&nbsp;incredible amount of&nbsp;core and leg strength was also needed.</p><p><h2>3. Why he&nbsp;only wore one glove</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ca/a59/2b49795521a59856601702a346.jpg><p>Michael had <a href=# title=vitiligo data-link=tag>vitiligo</a>, a&nbsp;skin condition where patches of&nbsp;your skin lose pigment. It&nbsp;started on&nbsp;his hand and he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;<a href=#>cover</a> it&nbsp;up. And he&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;would look too ordinary to&nbsp;wear 2&nbsp;gloves, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;would only wear one.</p><p><h2>4. Why almost every jacket had an&nbsp;armband on&nbsp;the right sleeve</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/219/57b/70d657529ca1a2f6a15e1ef964.jpg><p>Michel Jackson just wanted his clothes to&nbsp;be&nbsp;different from everyone else’s. And having an&nbsp;armband on&nbsp;a&nbsp;sleeve makes your look distinguishable. Michael also <a href=#>liked</a> to&nbsp;make his fans wonder why that armband was there.</p><p><h2>5. Why there are 3 №&nbsp;7s&nbsp;sewn onto his jackets</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac7/bf0/52cdd65d65b6792da3ebc0c809.jpg><p><a href=#>Michael</a> was the 7th child in&nbsp;his family. Also, he&nbsp;was born in&nbsp;1958, and if&nbsp;you add 19&nbsp;plus&nbsp;58, it&nbsp;equals&nbsp;77.</p><p><h2>6. Why he&nbsp;never polished his shoes</h2></p><p>Once, the singer`s managers were concerned about the condition of&nbsp;his shoes and asked his costume designer to&nbsp;<a href=#>polish</a> them. He&nbsp;did&nbsp;it, but it&nbsp;made Michael extremely angry. He&nbsp;explained that the leather was worn off exactly as&nbsp;he&nbsp;needed it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be, and that polishing would make it&nbsp;too slippery for him to&nbsp;perform his dance moves.</p><p><h2>7. Why he&nbsp;wore white socks</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/504/74e/7d768256dd9e7f8832bdcf4a7b.jpg><p>Michael loved wearing white <a href=#>socks</a> for several reasons. No&nbsp;one else wore white socks with black shoes. Moreover, they would catch the light and attract attention to&nbsp;the movements of&nbsp;his feet when he&nbsp;was dancing.</p><p><h2>8. Why he&nbsp;taped his fingers</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dad/d73/eae69556d087dbc35e5dfd38aa.jpg><p>Hand movements were an&nbsp;important part of&nbsp;Michael Jackson`s dance routines. So&nbsp;he&nbsp;and his costume designers decided to&nbsp;wrap white tape around his <a href=#>fingers</a> in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;attract more light. Michael also decided it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;more unusual to&nbsp;only tape his index, ring, and pinkie fingers. It&nbsp;was also fun for him, because fans would ask why only 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;his fingers were taped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc1/df0/a901b75bf7a1e0d21cce493704.jpg><p>When Michael danced, he&nbsp;would unconsciously put his 2&nbsp;untaped fingers together. And that would also add mysteriousness to&nbsp;his performances, since the fans would think this sign had a&nbsp;secret meaning.</p><h2>9. What the letters CTE on&nbsp;his jackets stand for</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e1f/c1c/abdd155ab290d64329061d08e0.jpg><p>These <a href=#>letters</a> don`t stand for anything. In&nbsp;the 90s, Michael`s costume designers created a&nbsp;few new shirts for him. He&nbsp;liked them, but he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;add some letters on&nbsp;the epaulets. He&nbsp;said it&nbsp;didn`t matter which ones, so&nbsp;his costume designers put all of&nbsp;the letters of&nbsp;the alphabet into a&nbsp;hat, and took 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;them out at&nbsp;random. That`s where the letters “CTE” came from.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think Michael Jackson had great taste in&nbsp;clothes? Is&nbsp;there any costume of&nbsp;his that you like in&nbsp;particular? We`d love to&nbsp;hear your thoughts in&nbsp;the comments!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYymoJygkZq5brbAnKKsp55ixLC%2BxGaqppmcobKzecKlpq2glah6osCMrZ%2BeZZWjsW67xWafoqtdqLWww9JmmKecXW16rrvRnmSrnaaauaLAyKilrGWRl7y2wIyhoKxlk6TAtcHMnqpmb2lrgHR%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-great-pumpkin-race.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>World-Record Giant Pumpkins and the People who Grow Them</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./countries.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Provo History Timeline - Important Dates &amp;amp; People</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
