Convenience aside, contacts can even give you a completely new look if you explore the world of prescription colored contacts—there’s a wide range of shades on the market that can enhance your natural eye color, or give you a bold new look with tints like teal and amethyst. As long as you choose quality products that won’t damage or scratch your eye (more on this below), and that require a prescription and an eye exam screened by a doctor, contacts can be a fun way to spice up your appearance. Below, you’ll find our selections for the absolute best places to buy colored contacts.</p><p>There are a few things to keep in mind to help you make the right choice:</p><h3>Quality prescription</h3><p>The most important thing is to avoid buying contacts without a prescription, as you risk damaging or scratching your eyes if you buy products that aren’t vetted or prescribed by an eye doctor. Even if you have perfect vision, you can obtain a prescription for lenses that are non-corrective.</p><p>“A contact lens, even if it has no corrective power and is worn for a cosmetic purpose, still needs to be applied to the front surface of the eye, and this comes with risks,” warns <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bhavin Shah</a>, a London, U.K.-based behavioral optometrist and contact lens specialist. “The most serious is a risk of infection. The shape of the lens may not suit the shape of the front of your eye and cause excessive movement of the lens, which can lead to damage to the ocular surface. Or, the lens may not allow adequate oxygen or moisture to the eye.”</p><p>“The only way to be sure is to have a fitting by a registered practitioner,” Shah continues. “They have the equipment to ensure the fitting is suitable and they can prescribe a lens brand that is suitable and tailored for the unique measurements of your eyes. It’s impossible to tell if a lens would be safe unless a practitioner examines you.”</p><h3>Lens materials</h3><p>“Some contact lens materials are much better than others,” says Shah. “Also, one material might suit one person better, while a different material would be more appropriate for someone else. Some companies spend a lot of time and research developing better materials, while other companies use older materials–some of the lens materials on the market that people use are older than the first iPhone, yet you would never see them using a first generation iPhone!”</p><p>In terms of the actual materials used, modern soft contact lenses tend to be made from either hydrogel or silicone hydrogel, with the latter being much more commonly prescribed. Both are flexible and comfortable, but silicone hydrogel lenses generally have better oxygen permeation, which reduces the risk of corneal hypoxia (a condition that occurs when your cornea doesn’t receive enough oxygen). This is why silicone hydrogel is normally used for lenses intended to be worn for extended periods, or overnight, too.</p><h3>Variety</h3><p>You can get anything from transparent lenses meant to enhance your natural lighter eye color, to bold, bright colored tints to make a statement. Whether you’re looking for a small change or something striking, there are a variety of options, so make sure you’re buying quality products and have a prescription.</p><h3>Customer service</h3><p>Customer service is often overlooked and is an important factor to consider when you’re buying from a specific company or website. Good customer service can make a difference in your experience, and guide you toward the right product.</p><h3>Shipping and return policies</h3><p>Whenever you’re buying online it’s always a plus if there’s a reliable return policy and free shipping. If it’s not free, go for inexpensive, at least–you don’t always know what will work for you until you try it, so it’s good to have that insurance policy.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Price is a big factor. Make sure you’re getting a great deal, as some companies offer a first-time buyer discount on your initial order or free shipping to sweeten the deal.</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>AC Lens</a></h3><p>AC Lens has free shipping for U.S.-based customers and a variety of colored contact shades available.
