This phenomenon even has a&nbsp;special term&nbsp;— <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>famous for being famous</a>. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;slightly dismissive since it&nbsp;is&nbsp;used in&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;stars who have gained popularity not because of&nbsp;their talent but simply because of&nbsp;their frequent appearance in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=media data-link=tag>media</a>.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> were curious to&nbsp;figure out the reasons for the appearance of&nbsp;this phenomenon and we&nbsp;came to&nbsp;the conclusion that it&nbsp;originated in&nbsp;the 19th century.</p><p><h2>What it&nbsp;all started with and who was the first celebrity.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/197/358/3592fb51adbfb2eb9489cb5341.jpg><p>The term “celebrity” was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>created</a> by&nbsp;the American historian and social theorist Daniel J. Boorstin in&nbsp;1961. He&nbsp;said that “the graphic revolution in&nbsp;journalism and other forms of&nbsp;communication had severed fame from greatness, and that this severance hastened the decay of&nbsp;fame into mere notoriety.” The idea of&nbsp;“celebrity” reflected the new phenomenon that surprised many people, “In&nbsp;the past, if&nbsp;someone was famous or&nbsp;notorious, it&nbsp;was for something—as a&nbsp;writer or&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=# title=actor data-link=tag>actor</a> or&nbsp;a&nbsp;criminal&nbsp;— for some talent or&nbsp;distinction or&nbsp;abomination. Today one is&nbsp;famous for being famous. People who come up&nbsp;to&nbsp;one in&nbsp;the street or&nbsp;in&nbsp;public places to&nbsp;claim recognition nearly always say:<strong> “I’ve seen you on&nbsp;the telly!”</strong></p><p>A&nbsp;19-century French dancer <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Cléo de&nbsp;Mérode</a> can be&nbsp;considered one of&nbsp;the first celebs whose image was widely recognized. She was called the “first true celebrity.” She was also <strong>the first woman whose pics got spread around the world</strong> in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;postcards. We&nbsp;can say it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;analog of&nbsp;today’s <a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a>.</p><p>Cléo was the illegitimate daughter of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Viennese Baroness and she became popular not only thanks to&nbsp;her dancing but more so&nbsp;thanks to&nbsp;her bright appearance, glamourous look, and various rumors. Also, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>brought</a> into <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> a&nbsp;hairstyle that covers both ears, and many <strong>people started to&nbsp;assume that she was missing one or&nbsp;both of&nbsp;her ears</strong>. Moreover, society was actively discussing her personal life, in&nbsp;particular, her alleged <a href=# title=romance data-link=tag>romance</a> with the king of&nbsp;Belgium. What’s more, once she appeared on&nbsp;stage in&nbsp;a&nbsp;light pink gauze tunic, which created the illusion of&nbsp;a&nbsp;naked body&nbsp;— that’s when everyone started to&nbsp;talk about Cléo even more. She was one of&nbsp;the most popular women in&nbsp;France at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 19th and the beginning of&nbsp;the 20th century and she <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>got</a> the title of&nbsp;the most beautiful woman in&nbsp;Paris in&nbsp;1898.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;socialite who became famous for the number of&nbsp;husbands she had in&nbsp;the ’50s of&nbsp;the last century</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b6/ead/e012465bd1b98e929a6c01ce7b.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Zsa Zsa Gabor</a>, an&nbsp;American actress and socialite who was in&nbsp;the spotlight in&nbsp;the 1950s, can be&nbsp;called another bright example of&nbsp;this phenomenon. Once, historian and critic Neal Gabler introduced the term “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Zsa Zsa Factor</a>” to&nbsp;describe the phenomenon of&nbsp;fame that came from unknown origins. Although she is&nbsp;listed as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress in&nbsp;all sources, it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;noted that <strong>her filmography is&nbsp;much less impressive than her extravagant behavior and the list of&nbsp;her husbands</strong>. Zsa Zsa had 9&nbsp;husbands, including the hotel magnate Conrad Hilton and the famous actor George Sanders.</p><p>The story of&nbsp;Gabor’s success is&nbsp;pretty demonstrative: After several appearances in&nbsp;films, she didn’t leave the&nbsp;TV screens and regularly appeared on&nbsp;various&nbsp;TV shows. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, she created an&nbsp;image of&nbsp;the ubiquitous socialite for herself. Of&nbsp;course, the details of&nbsp;her personal life, and all sorts of&nbsp;scandals and sensations, constantly made it&nbsp;into the press.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, Zsa Zsa had 2&nbsp;sisters who also became actresses and repeated her fate to&nbsp;some extent. TV&nbsp;host Merv Griffin <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>wrote</a> in&nbsp;his autobiography, “All these years later, <strong>it’s hard to&nbsp;describe the phenomenon of&nbsp;the 3&nbsp;glamorous Gabor girls </strong>and their ubiquitous mother. They burst onto the society pages and into the gossip columns so&nbsp;suddenly, and with such force, it&nbsp;was as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they’d been dropped out of&nbsp;the sky.”</p><p>It’s interesting to&nbsp;know that Zsa Zsa lived to&nbsp;be&nbsp;99&nbsp;and witnessed the blossom of&nbsp;another socialite whom she was related to&nbsp;— <a href=# title="Paris Hilton" data-link=tag>Paris Hilton</a>.</p><p><h2>The re-appearance of&nbsp;the phenomenon in&nbsp;the ’00s thanks to&nbsp;the granddaughter of&nbsp;a&nbsp;talented granddad</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a12/c81/3410fc5cd486552961f01401f6.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Conrad Hilton</a> was a&nbsp;successful businessman who remains in&nbsp;history as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person who created a&nbsp;revolution in&nbsp;the hotel business and as&nbsp;the founder of&nbsp;the Hilton hotels chain. It&nbsp;was he&nbsp;who made hotels the way we&nbsp;see them now. Conrad united them with restaurants and <a href=# title=entertainment data-link=tag>entertainment</a>, having turned hotels from places for sleeping into places where one can have a&nbsp;good time. Also, he&nbsp;came up&nbsp;with the idea to&nbsp;grant stars to&nbsp;hotels.</p><p>It&nbsp;was his great-granddaughter who became one of&nbsp;the most popular celebrities in&nbsp;the ’00s. She was known all over the world, the name Paris Hilton was always there on&nbsp;magazine covers but at&nbsp;the same time, no&nbsp;one could explain what she was famous for. <strong>According to&nbsp;the official version, Paris Hilton is&nbsp;a&nbsp;model, actress, singer,</strong> and <strong>designer</strong>, but in&nbsp;none of&nbsp;these areas has she left a&nbsp;significant mark that is&nbsp;comparable to&nbsp;her fame. Fame came to&nbsp;Paris after taking part in&nbsp;the reality show<i> </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>The Simple Life</i></a> where she filmed together with her friend <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Nicole Richie</a> who also became a&nbsp;socialite.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ccf/6b3/12abc1592db76c3efb7f5da86c.jpg><p>Hilton became the very woman who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>resurrected</a> the phenomenon of&nbsp;“famous for being famous” and had a&nbsp;huge impact on&nbsp;the masses of&nbsp;the 2000s. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appeared</a> <strong>in&nbsp;the Guinness Book of&nbsp;World Records in&nbsp;2007&nbsp;as the most overrated celebrity </strong>to&nbsp;succeed solely through inherited wealth and a&nbsp;luxurious lifestyle. However, Paris went further and managed to&nbsp;monetize her popularity by&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;brand with the same name. Today, her perfume line alone brought in&nbsp;an&nbsp;income of&nbsp;more than $2.5&nbsp;billion. In&nbsp;2011, <i>Variety </i>magazine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>called</a> Hilton a&nbsp;“Billion Dollar Entrepreneur.”</p><p><h2>The phenomenon of&nbsp;the Kardashian family</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/15a/062/dee0e459d8b0283ae9c2db0256.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2011, TV&nbsp;host Barbara Walters, invited <a href=# title="Kris Jenner" data-link=tag>Kris Jenner</a> and her daughters, Kim, Khloé and Kourtney to&nbsp;her annual program about the most outstanding people of&nbsp;the year. The host <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>asked</a> the guests, “<strong>You don’t really act, you don’t sing, you don’t dance. You don’t have, forgive&nbsp;me, any talents.</strong>” And Khloé replied, “But we&nbsp;are still entertaining people.” And Kim added, “I&nbsp;think it’s more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;challenge for you to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;reality show and get people to&nbsp;fall in&nbsp;love with you for being you. So&nbsp;there is&nbsp;definitely a&nbsp;lot more pressure I&nbsp;think.” As&nbsp;curious as&nbsp;it&nbsp;might sound, Kim used to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>work</a> as&nbsp;Paris Hilton’s personal assistant for a&nbsp;while.</p><p>Today the Kardashian&nbsp;— Jenner family is&nbsp;even <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>called</a> a&nbsp;“cultural phenomenon.” Many people are still wondering how they managed to&nbsp;get famous all over the world and create a&nbsp;whole business empire that is&nbsp;based only on&nbsp;the popularity of&nbsp;the sisters and their mother. After all, it&nbsp;all started with participation in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>reality show</a>, but then, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;by&nbsp;magic, everything that the Kardashian family touched started to&nbsp;turn to&nbsp;gold. Today, the famous sisters produce clothes, underwear, cosmetics, jewelry, work as&nbsp;models, and have become one of&nbsp;the key figures in&nbsp;modern pop culture. At&nbsp;the same time, their most important talent is&nbsp;<strong>their ability to&nbsp;constantly warm up&nbsp;interest to&nbsp;their personalities </strong>and not fall out of&nbsp;the media’s field of&nbsp;vision.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e4/cd1/8e0a5a55898d7edd22d61a5925.jpg><p><h2>What are the reasons for this phenomenon and what is&nbsp;happening with it&nbsp;today?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0dc/e3c/96f05e5d0896882ed9bf81d734.jpg><p>Experts <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>outline</a> 2&nbsp;versions explaining the appearance of&nbsp;celebrities. According to&nbsp;the first one, celebrity is&nbsp;a&nbsp;universal concept that has existed and will exist in&nbsp;any society and at&nbsp;any time. The other version says that <strong>the celebrity phenomenon is&nbsp;connected with the growth of&nbsp;popular culture</strong> when video and audio media started to&nbsp;dominate in&nbsp;society. That&nbsp;is, there have always been famous people, but their popularity was due to&nbsp;real talent, while today’s stars are famous because their lives are actively covered by&nbsp;the media. At&nbsp;the same time, society clearly shows its interest in&nbsp;it&nbsp;— look at&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;followers on&nbsp;the social networks of&nbsp;stars. This happens for several reasons.</p><p>According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>psychologist</a>, “Perhaps some people who don’t feel good about themselves and are not able to&nbsp;get what they want out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;real relationship because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fear of&nbsp;rejection <strong>can feel a&nbsp;connection with a&nbsp;celebrity</strong> and get something positive out of&nbsp;that.” In&nbsp;other words, it’s a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;cope with the difficulties of&nbsp;everyday life.</p><p>Also, there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>opinion</a>, according to&nbsp;which, society has a&nbsp;wish to&nbsp;worship all idols. We&nbsp;obsessively follow the daily life of&nbsp;celebrities, we&nbsp;are interested in&nbsp;everything: from love dramas to&nbsp;everyday things like what kind of&nbsp;coffee they drink. Personal aspects of&nbsp;life become more important than professional achievements. In&nbsp;this sense, the line between a&nbsp;star and ordinary person is&nbsp;blurred, because today we&nbsp;also voluntarily flaunt our lives on&nbsp;social networks. And one can think, “She is&nbsp;like me&nbsp;and has had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;success in&nbsp;life. Perhaps, I&nbsp;will also be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d5f/5d6/89970a517d8e0ee801c9d83cb1.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not surprising that under these conditions, the celebrity phenomenon has greatly <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>expanded</a> its boundaries over the past 20&nbsp;years. With the spread of&nbsp;the internet, <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, and <a href=# title=YouTube data-link=tag>YouTube</a>, the number of&nbsp;people “famous for being famous” is&nbsp;growing and will continue to&nbsp;grow.
