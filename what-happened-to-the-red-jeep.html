The Myrtle Beach Police Department tells TIME that when officers were called to the scene, they discovered the SUV was locked and abandoned. “It was in what looked like a washout and it was stuck there,” a police spokesman says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Brittany and Nick Feliciano identified themselves as the “actual owners of the red Jeep” on a <a href=# rel=noopener>GoFundMe page</a> started to raise money for donation money for UNICEF to aid with <a href=# rel=noopener>Dorian relief</a> in the Bahamas.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the time, according to the <a href=# rel=noopener>WMBF News report</a>, the anonymous owner said that his cousin had borrowed the jeep to drive to the beach and capture a video of the pre-storm sunrise, but ended up getting stuck. “So he got on the beach and started driving it,” WMBF News quoted him saying. “I guess there’s that runoff there and he didn’t realize it was in front of him, he was looking out the window when he went off and got stuck.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The owner went on to say that although his cousin tried to get help removing the jeep, the steadily worsening weather conditions made it impossible.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But that didn’t stop people from flocking to the beach to take photos and videos of the jeep as the tide rose and heavy rains and winds began to batter the coastline. And of course, there were <a href=# rel=noopener>red jeep memes</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“What we ended up doing was closing off that area of the beach,” the police spokesman tells TIME. “The issue was that people kept climbing onto [the jeep] and getting near it during the storm. With the waves moving in and out, it became very dangerous.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One video taken at the scene even shows a man standing next to the jeep while playing “Amazing Grace” on the bagpipes. However, the funeral dirge turned out to be a little premature, as the SUV survived the night on the beach without getting carried away by the ocean.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The jeep was removed from the beach on Friday morning. “It took a backhoe and lifted it up and pulled it right off the beach,” the police spokesman says. “Last I saw, [the jeep was] being loaded onto a tow truck and I’m not sure where it went from there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubmdlhXKFjrCfmqxdna6xvMSnnJ1lpKR6tbTEZqmenF2fsqa8jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./white-people-tough-conversations-race.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>It's Time For White People to Have Tough Conversations</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1460857-connor-finnertys-biography-age-height-birthday-girlfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Connor Finnertys biography: age, height, birthday, girlfriend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
