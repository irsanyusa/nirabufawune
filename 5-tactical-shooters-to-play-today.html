Offering a slightly slower and more carefully considered first-person shooter genre which can occasionally feel quite happy-go-lucky. Let’s take a look at 5 tactical shooters which will get your mind racing and your heart thumping.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-3>Rainbow Six Siege</h2></p><p>Arguably the king of tactical shooters, Rainbow Six Siege has been delivering intense, squad-based tactical thrills for almost a decade… and it still hasn’t fallen off. This round-based shooter packs squads into intense, close-quarters shootouts with each round pitting hinging on players’ pinpoint accuracy and cunning use of gadgets and abilities.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Through its different operators, abilities and maps, it offers a wide range of approaches made incredibly satisfying by a steep learning curve and rewarding payoff. Honestly, if you want a tactical shooter and still haven’t played Siege—do it. You can even give yourself a head start if you <a href=# id=4e814059-3b59-4ebe-9c7e-503ea164d6a3 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>buy r6 credits</a>.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>Counter-Strike 2</h2></p><p>Counter-Strike has been a titan in the gaming industry since 2000. Let that sink in for a moment. This game is still one of the most played and loved games, and it’s formula has barely changed for 24 years. That says something seriously impressive about the thrills Counter-Strike has to offer.</p><p>Fortunately for us, Counter-Strike recently had a facelift with the release of Counter-Strike 2, updating the game with an all new look and other changes.</p><p>CS:GO is a classic, so you’ve probably played it at least once before. So it’s time to dive back into this tactical shooter with one of the highest and most competitive skill ceilings in gaming.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>Escape from Tarkov</h2></p><p>If you’re a lover of MMOs and FPS games, you historically haven’t had many games which offer a satisfying cross-over. But then there’s Escape from Tarkov, which is a tactical FPS MMO. Yes, seriously. Developed by Battletate Games for Windows, the game takes place in a fictional region of Russia where players choose a faction and join battles to duke it out for loot and survival.</p><p>Oh, did I mention it’s a hardcore game? If you die, you lose a lot. Think original Runescape amounts. So it’s not a game for the faint of heart… but then again, we are talking about tactical FPS games here.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>Valorant</h2></p><p>Taking cues from Counter-Strike and Overwatch, Valorant is Riot Games’ take on the tactical shooter. Offering round-based objective game modes which will be familiar to any Counter-Strike player. The twist here is that you get to choose an agent with specific abilities—from creating barriers to recon to reviving teammates.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Valorant is Overwatch’s intense older brother—or Counter-Strike’s more playful younger sibling. Whichever way you want to think of it, Valorant is worth a go. Especially considering that it’s totally free on Riot Games.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>Vail (VR)</h2></p><p>Vail brings the thrills of tactical shooters into VR, seeing players immerse their full bodies on the twitchy thrills which come from the genre. Vail sets itself apart from the other games on this list as you have to actually grab the weapons and pull the triggers with your very own hands.</p><p>Vail is immersive to say the least, but another advantage of it is that it totally levels the playing field. Shooting with a controller is totally different from shooting in VR, allowing players to learn a new way to play.</p><p>Vail already has an impressive esports scene for a VR game, so it may well be the future of the tactical shooter… we’ll have to wait and see.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>Which Tactical Shooter is for Me?</h2></p><p>Every game on this list is worth your time, with each offering a different take or format to experience the thrills of tactical shooters. The only way to figure out which one you will enjoy the most is to dive in… so what are you waiting for? It’s time to get tactical.</p><p><strong>#FeatureByTacticalShooter</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miqqaeiqcBwgYytmJysmZiurXnSoaaorJWnwG7AzmanpZmpYsGwsMCyZqqaZWuzprc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carolina-herrera-claims-classy-women-should-never-wear-tennis-shoes-they-look-horrible-819044.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carolina Herrera Claims Its Unclassy to Wear Sneakers: They Look Horrible</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./canadas-got-talent-decides-top-8-acts-going-to-the-finals.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Canada's Got Talent' Decides Top 8 Acts Going to the Finals</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
