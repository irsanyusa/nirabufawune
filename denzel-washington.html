Throughout his four-decade career, Washington has earned two Oscars and a Tony award, and has been nominated for two Emmys and a Grammy. After holding roles Off-Broadway and in small films, Washington got his first big break in 1982 as Dr. Phillip Chandler in the NBC medical drama series “St. Elsewhere,” breaking ground as one of the only Black actors to appear on the series for its entire six-year run. That opportunity led to several film, TV and stage roles, and 1987 brought Washington’s first Oscar nomination for supporting actor in Richard Attenborough’s “Cry Freedom.” In 1989, Washington won his first Oscar, for best supporting actor in “Glory,” in which he portrayed a formerly enslaved soldier.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">One of Washington’s most acclaimed roles came as the title character in Spike Lee’s “Malcolm X” (1992), for which he was nominated for best actor. Lee and Washington collaborated once again with 1998’s “He Got Game,” and Washington enjoyed a string of successful movies in the late ’90s including “Fallen,” “The Bone Collector” and “The Hurricane.” Washington won his second Oscar in 2001 for his portrayal of a corrupt L.A. policeman in “Training Day,” making him only the second Black actor to win best actor. At this time, Washington began his foray into directing, making his debut with 2002’s “Antwone Fisher,” in which he also starred. After starring in Ridley Scott’s “American Gangster” (2007), Washington directed his second movie, “The Great Debaters.” Washington made his return to theater in 2010 starring in August Wilson’s play “Fences,” which earned him a Tony award. He would later direct the film adaptation in 2016, starring Viola Davis. In the 2010s, Washington appeared in a flurry of well-received movies including “The Book of Eli” (2010), “Flight” (2012), “The Equalizer” (2014)” and “The Magnificent Seven” (2016). More recently, Washington portrayed Macbeth in the 2021 film adaptation of the iconic Shakespeare play and was nominated for an Oscar for his work.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BpfKWxzbOcpWWnlsCptc2gq6imXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1501634-dollar-scarcity-crashes-naira-n900-a-dollar-black-market.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dollar Scarcity Crashes Naira to N900 to a Dollar at the Black Market</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./realisation-agdatahub-intermediaire-donnees.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Agdatahub : Financement Projet | Banque des Territoires</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
