I've always followed a mostly dairy-free diet (yay, lactose-intolerance!), but now I'm cutting out foods filled with whey and limiting my egg consumption to less than a dozen a month. Unfortunately, I'm not ready to commit to being vegan full-time, but I am happy to further reduce my animal product consumption to help the world around me but I'm not giving up sugar just yet. Sorry, Ellen!</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8hmnaiknKTEprCMnqOlnZ5isaazxKecq52jYsC1vsicq2aulZyur3nDopytZZakv26tjLCcnqNdlrulechmm6impGK4r7vWZp%2Bor12otaZ5w6icrGdpq7SlvpJq</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./johnny-depp-denies-claims-that-he-verbally-abused-costar-lola-glaudini-in-2001.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Johnny Depp denies claims that he verbally abused costar Lola Glaudini in 2001</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-prepare-plantain-and-egg-pizza-for-a-special-breakfast.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to prepare plantain and egg pizza for a special breakfast</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
