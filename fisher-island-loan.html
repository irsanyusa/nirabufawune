Around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">700 families</a> live on the island, which can only be accessed by boat.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The association faced sharp criticism after news of the loan being granted broke. <a href=# rel=noopener>According to its website,</a> the Fisher Island Community Association’s “primary responsibility” is to “manage, maintain and improve the common areas of Fisher Island.” That includes the island’s Public Safety Department, which staffs “numerous strategic posts 24 hours a day 7 days a week,” as well as a landscaping department that includes “a 7 day a week landscape staff.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Paycheck Protection Program has faced controversy in recent days, as it has become clear that some large publicly traded companies — <a href=# rel=noopener>some valued at over $100 million, according to the Associated Press</a> — swiftly received loans while the applications of small businesses were denied because funding ran out.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Funds were intended to go to businesses with 500 employees or less, but the large restaurant chains Shake Shack and Potbelly were each <a href=# rel=noopener>granted $10 million loans;</a> both have since said they’ll return the money. The Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse chain was granted $20 million, which it will also return. And AutoNation, the country’s largest car dealer chain — and is valued at $3 billion according to the Wall Street Journal — also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">returned the $77 million loan</a> it received.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ana Tinsly, a spokeswoman for the union SEIU Florida, <a href=# rel=noopener>told the Miami Herald</a> that its 130 members who work on Fisher island have not experienced layoffs and have been given extra paid days off to facilitate social distancing. (SEIU Florida did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Herald reports that FICA told island residents on Wednesday that it had applied for the loan on April 4 and was approved for it on Monday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Once the loan was approved, FICA reportedly asked the island’s residents to weigh in on whether or not they should accept the loan. “It is very important to the board of Directors to take into consideration the views of our members,” the Association said in an email to its residents seen by<a href=# rel=noopener> the Herald.</a> “It is also important to the board that the right decision is made for the island.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Florida news channel <a href=# rel=noopener>Local 10 reports</a> that many of those residents joined a virtual call on Friday night with board members, who <a href=# rel=noopener>decided to not accept the loan.</a> (A representative for Fisher Island could not be immediately reached for comment on the loan, or residents’ ensuing rejection.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“What are we getting $2 million for and why are we applying for $2 million?” one Fisher Island resident told Local 10, an ABC affiliate, adding that he didn’t think the island needed the money.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As of Saturday afternoon ET, <a href=#>Florida</a> had at least 30,839 confirmed cases of coronavirus and at least 1,055 deaths, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to a tracker by Johns Hopkins University.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Friday, President Donald Trump <a href=# rel=noopener>signed a bill refunding the Paycheck Protection Program </a>with another $310 billion; applications for a second round of loans should open soon. In the past five weeks, over 26 million people <a href=#>have filed for unemployment</a> in the United States — about one in six Americans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZucGJsgnGFjp%2BgrKCVp3qqv8uapZ1lnKSur3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./les-campagnes-profitent-de-la-croissance-demographique-francaise.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Les campagnes profitent de la croissance dmographique franaise</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emotional-dance-routines-wow-canadas-got-talent-as-auditions-continue.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emotional Dance Routines Wow 'Canada's Got Talent' as Auditions Continue</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
