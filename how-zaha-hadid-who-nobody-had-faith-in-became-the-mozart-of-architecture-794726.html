In&nbsp;2019, she would have turned 68&nbsp;years old. She refused to&nbsp;see things in&nbsp;an&nbsp;ordinary way, her projects were called impossible to&nbsp;build and insane, she lost bids for 17&nbsp;years, but she became the woman who totally changed the world of&nbsp;<a href=# title=architecture data-link=tag>architecture</a>.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have always been charmed by&nbsp;the futuristic shapes of&nbsp;buildings of&nbsp;the great architect that are still being built today, after Hadid’s death, and we&nbsp;hope that her story will motivate&nbsp;us to&nbsp;try and implement our most amazing ideas.</p><p><h2>This architecture superstar was born in&nbsp;1950 in&nbsp;Baghdad.</h2></p><p>Zaha <a href=#>was born</a> into a&nbsp;wealthy Iraqi family so&nbsp;she didn’t have this classic story about a&nbsp;difficult childhood. By&nbsp;the way, the famous models Gigi and <a href=# title="Bella Hadid" data-link=tag>Bella Hadid</a> are not related to&nbsp;Zaha, even though their father is&nbsp;also linked to&nbsp;the construction business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b20/b19/17c11f5e7b9b385465fb959173.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the beginning, Zaha wanted to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mathematician and even studied science at&nbsp;the American University of&nbsp;Beirut. But at&nbsp;some point, she just realized that she really loved shapes, not numbers, and she shifted her concentration to&nbsp;architecture.</p><p>Soon after that, Hadid went to&nbsp;<a href=# title=London data-link=tag>London</a> where she met the famous Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas. He&nbsp;noticed Zaha’s talent right away and became her mentor.</p><p><strong>The mentor called Zaha “a&nbsp;planet in&nbsp;her own orbit.”</strong> After Hadid finished the university, Koolhaas invited the young Hadid to&nbsp;work for his bureau in&nbsp;Rotterdam. After 3&nbsp;years of&nbsp;collaboration, Zaha decided that she was ready to&nbsp;start her own independent firm and so&nbsp;she returned to&nbsp;London.</p><p><h2>For 17&nbsp;years, Hadid’s projects got rejected and she was called a&nbsp;“paper architect.”</h2></p><p>When she dove into the world of&nbsp;architecture, Hadid worked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;projects but they were criticized over and over again. <strong>Despite the amazing number of&nbsp;her ideas, before the beginning of&nbsp;the 90s, not a&nbsp;single building based on&nbsp;her blueprints was built</strong>.</p><p>Zaha’s projects won huge international competitions, but they remained only on&nbsp;paper because they were believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;insane: <strong>too impossible to&nbsp;actually build</strong>. All that Zaha could do&nbsp;was continue to&nbsp;work “just in&nbsp;case” and hope that architecture would soon take a&nbsp;step forward.</p><p>And in&nbsp;1982, it&nbsp;seemed that she got lucky: one of&nbsp;Hadid’s projects was approved&nbsp;— a&nbsp;sports club in&nbsp;the mountains of&nbsp;Hong Kong. But one year later, the customer canceled the construction and the project was not built.</p><p>Using the money she won in&nbsp;various competitions, <strong>Zaha decided to&nbsp;open her own office</strong> that would become a&nbsp;real empire 30&nbsp;years later. Zaha didn’t give up&nbsp;and thanks to&nbsp;her persistence and strong nature, she continued to&nbsp;create her crazy, but beautiful projects.</p><p><h2>She constructed her first building at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;44. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;fire department.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bee/813/9f60a35eba91cd2480e880b5f4.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>On&nbsp;the left is&nbsp;the IBA house, on&nbsp;the right is&nbsp;the Vitra fire department.</p><p><strong>In&nbsp;1993, Hadid’s first project was finally built</strong>&nbsp;— a&nbsp;small fire department for a&nbsp;Vitra furniture company. It&nbsp;became a&nbsp;true masterpiece. It&nbsp;was something completely new in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;architecture at&nbsp;the time. The building was really impressive in&nbsp;its shape&nbsp;— the curved and bent concrete slabs looked as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they froze while dancing.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, that same year, another building by&nbsp;Zaha’s design was built&nbsp;— <strong>an&nbsp;IBA house</strong>. The local feminist community helped her with this. They were fighting for the presence of&nbsp;women in&nbsp;the modern architecture of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Germany data-link=tag>Germany</a>.</p><p><h2>Zaha was a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;Kazimir Malevich and constructivism.</h2></p><p>Hadid was a&nbsp;big fan of&nbsp;<strong>Kazimir Malevich’s</strong> <a href=# title=art data-link=tag>art</a> and Russian avant-garde art in&nbsp;general. For her graduate work, a&nbsp;project for a&nbsp;bridge under the Thames, Zaha named it&nbsp;after the artist&nbsp;— Tectonics of&nbsp;Malevich.</p><p>Also, in&nbsp;her early projects, you can see the obvious connection with Russian constructivism. For example, if&nbsp;you compare her famous Vitra fire department with the works of&nbsp;constructivists, you can see the obvious similarities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ffd/c39/3daf22581089eaf3e64b7bb483.jpg><p>The famous architect managed to&nbsp;<strong>construct 2&nbsp;significant buildings in&nbsp;Russia</strong>. The first one was the futuristic mansion of&nbsp;Vladislav Doronin, near the Rublevo-Uspenskoe highway, and the second one was the Moscow business center Dominion Tower.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e9/fd9/f7da285852857f739b1378b65e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her future work, Zara preferred <strong>avant-garde</strong> and <strong>futurism</strong> styles.</p><p><h2>At&nbsp;the same time, Hadid got both the “Oscar” for architecture and accusations that her buildings were not functional.</h2></p><p>According to&nbsp;Zaha, the true interest in&nbsp;her works appeared after she took part in&nbsp;the construction of&nbsp;<strong>the Contemporary Arts Center in&nbsp;Cincinnati</strong>. Aside from that, it&nbsp;was the first <a href=# title=museum data-link=tag>museum</a> in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US that was designed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman and you <strong>could definitely tell it&nbsp;was Hadid’s work</strong>&nbsp;— the walls that were on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;each other, the sharp corners, and the unexpected shapes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5df/72c/9e892f5e6e9a4afa5b90a9b800.jpg><p>But the true triumph for Hadid came in&nbsp;2004. For her project for the London Aquatics Centre, she was awarded the <strong>Pritzker Architecture Prize,</strong> which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;like an&nbsp;Oscar in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;architecture. Zaha became the first woman to&nbsp;ever win this award.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a7/3a0/28bb385e8087c56695c333bb6e.jpg><p>After that, Hadid became one of&nbsp;the most popular and trendy architects in&nbsp;the entire world, but this also had a&nbsp;negative effect on&nbsp;her. <strong>The thing was that, soon, critics started to&nbsp;say that she was too interested in&nbsp;self-expression, rather than making her buildings functional.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/498/ebb/23d6665f8b8a962e6fac2227a9.jpg><p>So, after building the London Aquatics Centre, some viewers in&nbsp;the top rows complained that <strong>they couldn’t see what was happening in&nbsp;the pools of&nbsp;the arena because of&nbsp;the pretentious ceiling.</strong></p><p>Another example is&nbsp;the Modern Art Museum MAXXI in&nbsp;Rome. Experts think that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not suitable for exhibiting art. The thing&nbsp;is, the building is&nbsp;a&nbsp;long curved one-floor maze and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;place any objects there. Besides, the museum turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;so&nbsp;huge, that even the big paintings were kind of&nbsp;lost inside of&nbsp;it. So, the MAXXI building is&nbsp;a&nbsp;monument of&nbsp;its own.</p><p><h2>“Queen of&nbsp;the curve” was the description of&nbsp;Zaha’s creative methods.</h2></p><p>The Guardian <a href=#>called</a> Hadid the <strong>“Queen of&nbsp;the curve”</strong> that freed architectural geometry. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;true that Hadid spent her entire life breaking the stereotypes and the rules, and thinking outside the box. Besides, she denied geometry and she used a&nbsp;<strong>distorted perspective</strong> where curved lines were the center of&nbsp;attention.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/176/309/2731f556e68f57aafa23e0d656.jpg><p>Zaha almost always got what she wanted and did not allow anyone to&nbsp;doubt that she was right. This is&nbsp;probably why her most amazing projects ended up&nbsp;constructed and used, even though some people thought they were impossible.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, Zaha Hadid’s architecture firm was one of&nbsp;the first that started to&nbsp;use the <strong>parametric</strong> approach in&nbsp;design. This approach allowed them to&nbsp;process a&nbsp;huge amount of&nbsp;data, so&nbsp;that very difficult structures of&nbsp;buildings could be&nbsp;formed. Besides, <strong>composite plastic</strong> was used to&nbsp;build the fantastic projects of&nbsp;the architect. This material allowed her to&nbsp;build the most impossible shapes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f10/b70/2e0eb250338db31d6f1a071aae.jpg><p>In&nbsp;general, Hadid’s approach to&nbsp;architecture was very creative. She denied the function and rationalism and based her creations solely on&nbsp;her imagination.</p><p><h2>Year after year, Hadid’s projects became more and more expensive and unbelievable.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95f/031/ef2d825840ac0e2d9977e92459.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the beginning and in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the 2000s, Zaha made her most ambitious ideas a&nbsp;reality. Everyone knows Hadid’s pretentious style, and she even has wannabes. Her buildings aren’t just objects but true pieces of&nbsp;art. They have been compared to&nbsp;<strong>spaceships</strong>&nbsp;— this is&nbsp;how unusual they look to&nbsp;the human eye.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f26/1fc/98f58353e9b4ee4d981b08c4aa.jpg><p>Every next project Hadid does is&nbsp;more powerful than the previous ones. And of&nbsp;course, all of&nbsp;her ideas cost an&nbsp;awful lot of&nbsp;money. For example, the construction of&nbsp;the <strong>Dongdaemun Design</strong> <strong>Plaza </strong>in&nbsp;Seoul and the famous <strong>Heydar Aliyev Center</strong> in&nbsp;Baku cost hundreds of&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;dollars.</p><p>At&nbsp;the same time, the world was in&nbsp;an&nbsp;economic crisis in&nbsp;2008 and spending a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money on&nbsp;something like this was not the smartest idea. Later, Zaha was criticized that the space in&nbsp;her projects was not used efficiently. <strong>But the architecture superstar denied all these accusations and still managed to&nbsp;find customers</strong>. In&nbsp;China, the Middle East, everything was alright with the economy, so&nbsp;they were able to&nbsp;afford even the most expensive buildings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1d0/14b/2c582759dd8123e3290911873d.jpg><p>During this time, Hadid did projects like the 40-floor hotel in&nbsp;the Chinese city of&nbsp;Macao, an&nbsp;opera house in&nbsp;Guangzhou, a&nbsp;university in&nbsp;Hong Kong, and Galaxy SOHO in&nbsp;Beijing.</p><p><h2>The scandals about building the stadiums in&nbsp;Qatar and Japan</h2></p><p>Unfortunately, the final years of&nbsp;Zaha Hadid’s life were overshadowed by&nbsp;some unpleasant incidents in&nbsp;several countries. During the construction of&nbsp;her stadium project, <strong>several builders died</strong> in&nbsp;Qatar. The famous name of&nbsp;the architect triggered journalists and Zaha’s name often appeared in&nbsp;the media in&nbsp;a&nbsp;negative context, even though the design of&nbsp;the building was not dangerous for people.</p><p>Then, many critics thought that the <strong>Qatar stadium was shaped in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that was too extravagant, maybe even provocative</strong>: some people thought that the building looked like a&nbsp;female sex organ. The author called these ideas ridiculous and claimed that the shape of&nbsp;this stadium was inspired by&nbsp;a&nbsp;traditional Arabic boat called dhow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a7/df4/4d90e55c9d8b3340a4659496a6.jpg><p>Another problem arose during the construction of&nbsp;the Olympic stadium in&nbsp;Tokyo. The project seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<strong>too expensive</strong>: it&nbsp;would have taken $2&nbsp;billion to&nbsp;build&nbsp;it. The Japanese press even compared this stadium with a&nbsp;sea turtle that would drag Japan to&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the ocean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d0/786/fc4745550d8d9293e79d2eedd8.jpg><p>Later, the government decided against this idea in&nbsp;favor of&nbsp;a&nbsp;simpler and cheaper alternative.</p><p><h2>Even after the architect’s death, Hadid’s projects are still being implemented all over the world.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/08d/e11/632a765bac9c390374d7427383.jpg><p>Zaha Hadid <strong>died at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;65</strong>&nbsp;from a&nbsp;heart attack in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Miami clinic where she was being treated for bronchitis. One of&nbsp;the last projects she did was a&nbsp;house in&nbsp;New York.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e60/db3/0ea7025acabbed946574b069c8.jpg><p>Because architecture was Hadid’s only love, her projects were her family. But Hadid’s business continues to&nbsp;live&nbsp;on: her architecture firm partner, <strong>Patrik Schumacher,</strong> continues her work. They worked together for 28&nbsp;years, so&nbsp;Patrik totally shares and understands Zaha’s principles. At&nbsp;the moment, <strong>the bureau is&nbsp;working on&nbsp;implementing more than 30&nbsp;of&nbsp;Hadid’s works that are unfinished</strong>. Just recently, the Changsha Meixihu International Culture &&nbsp;Art Centre was built.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/78b/866/2e5e395acaa9da433ba8bdc097.jpg><p>Also, this fall, the biggest international airport, Daxing in&nbsp;Beijing, was opened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/653/c2e/aaa96a55aea5f142fd48f07a7b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the Saudi Arabia capital, the <strong>metro</strong> is&nbsp;<a href=#>going</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;opened and the main station of&nbsp;it&nbsp;was designed by&nbsp;Hadid. The main part of&nbsp;the station will be&nbsp;built of&nbsp;white marble and the walls will be&nbsp;covered with golden plaques. According to&nbsp;the author, she was inspired by&nbsp;the sand dunes of&nbsp;Saudi Arabia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/101/81b/a864e05ab3b3dbf7d22662d0cd.jpg><p>And this is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;exhaustive list of&nbsp;the projects from the Queen of&nbsp;architecture, that will soon be&nbsp;constructed. So&nbsp;we&nbsp;are sure that Zaha Hadid is&nbsp;still very much alive and with&nbsp;us.</p><p>Have you seen any of&nbsp;Zaha Hadid’s buildings with your own eyes?
