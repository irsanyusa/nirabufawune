It honors the <a href=# rel=noopener>1,074 women who served in the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)</a> corps during World War II. The WASPs became the first women to fly for the U.S. military, after training at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas, and were tasked with performing crucial domestic flying duties like ferrying military planes and serving on tow target squadrons. But the opportunity to join the WASP corps was largely limited to white women. While a <a href=# rel=noopener>handful of women of color served in the unit</a>, not a single Black applicant was accepted to the program.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>i can't get enough of the storytelling on these WNBA jerseys. it's just *chef's kiss*.</p><p>i'll start here: the Dallas Wings Nike Rebel Edition is inspired by the World War II P-40 Warhawk, a plane that was test-flown by Women Airforce Service Pilots (W.A.S.P.). <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DKejkabNZ9</a></p>— juju kennedy (@jujubeekennedy) <a href=#>April 9, 2021</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The outright rejection of Black women set WASP apart from other U.S. military services during this time, says <a href=# rel=noopener>Matthew F. Delmont</a>, a history professor at Dartmouth College who specializes in African-American History and the history of Civil Rights. “What stands out about the WASPs is that they excluded Black women entirely,” he tells TIME. “While the rest of the military and auxiliary services were segregated, they at least allowed African Americans to participate.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Although the creation of WASP was a landmark moment for women in the military, Delmont says that focusing solely on that narrative furthers the whitewashing of American history.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“What often isn’t talked about is the fact that even if white women were getting different and new opportunities, that almost always ran parallel with the maintenance or extension of racial discrimination and racial barriers,” he says. “To only talk about [white women’s side of the WASP] story and not also talk about the fact that Black women were denied that opportunity—even ones who were qualified and had commercial pilot’s licenses—misses the broader context. We can’t tell one story without telling the other.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an April 16 statement to TIME, Nike, the WNBA and the Wings, said they had made the joint decision to pull the Wings’ Rebel uniform: “The recently unveiled Dallas Wings Nike Rebel Edition uniform was designed to celebrate a group of Texas-based women pilots during World War II. However, Nike, the WNBA and the Dallas Wings recently learned the history of the program does not align with our shared values of diversity, equity and inclusion. As a result, the Dallas Wings will not wear this uniform on court, Nike and its partners are removing it from retail, and Nike and the Wings will work together on a new Nike Rebel Edition uniform design for the future.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some who criticized the Wings’ jersey, including former WNBA All-Star Kelsey Bone, had pointed out that by adopting the design as part of their team uniform, the Wings were calling on Black players to wear a jersey that celebrates an organization that intentionally excluded Black women.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Imagine making black women wear a jersey that celebrates an organization that wouldn’t allow black women in it.. Y’all have let that league play in your faces for a year... are y’all not tired?</p>— Kelsey Bone (@kelseybone3) <a href=#>April 14, 2021</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“With all their resources, the Wings, the WNBA and Nike somehow collectively botched this,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Jasmine Baker</a>, a women’s sports culturalist who helped make people aware of the controversial design on social media. “One reason why I wanted to bring this to people’s attention was that for fans who were considering purchasing the jersey, this [decision] was obviously going to be questionable at best. I think a lot of people don’t know the thorough history behind this.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>People keep asking me why I hate the Wings rebel jersey so much.</p><p>Those of us who understand America’s history also understand how that impacted our armed forces.</p><p>I knew no one, especially within the Wings org, had done their homework about WASP.</p><p>A simple google search.😒 <a href=#>https://t.co/3O2mmLDFxY</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/L1WwzLMq9D</a></p>— #BGisBack - Jasmine Baker🏀 (@WeGotGame2) <a href=#>April 14, 2021</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The WNBA’s forthcoming 25th season, set to tip off on May 14, arrives amid an ongoing reckoning on systemic racism in America as communities <a href=#>continue to protest against police shootings</a>. Less than a year ago, the league’s delayed 2020 season <a href=#>opened with players from the Seattle Storm and New York Liberty walking off the court</a> before the national anthem played as protests for racial justice took place across the country. The players jointly then dedicated 26 seconds of silence and the entire season to <a href=#>Breonna Taylor</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a <a href=# rel=noopener>July 2020 statement</a>, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert announced that the league’s 2020 season would be dedicated to social justice. “We are incredibly proud of WNBA players who continue to lead with their inspiring voices and effective actions in the league’s dedicated fight against systemic racism and violence,” she said. “Working together with the WNBPA and the teams, the league aims to highlight players’ social justice efforts throughout the 2020 season and beyond.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, some fans feel that the controversy surrounding the Wings’ jersey highlights how the WNBA hasn’t followed through on these commitments.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This is par for the course for the WNBA. At the end of the day, there’s a fundamental issue,” Baker says about the Wings’ jersey design. “As a Black woman who has followed this league, I’ve seen time and time again how it has failed Black women. Far too often when companies and teams mess up in this manner, they’ll come out with a statement and then it will be business as usual. They can highlight everything from last season, but for Black women to not even be considered when it came to these jerseys, there should be accountability for that.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This incident underscores how “surface-level diversity efforts” fail to address the problems at the heart of this issue, says former Wings Chief Marketing Officer Nicole Smith, who left the organization in 2017.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s unfortunate and disappointing considering the robust Black female fanbase and the proportion of Black female players. However, it also highlights the global need for competency, humility, and responsiveness around culture and intersectionality,” she tells TIME. “A solution will require an intentional culture shift where Black women are seen, heard, considered and, most importantly, valued.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZucWVphnaEjrClm5ldma6tuMCsZLChnpzAbrrIpJxmqpWXsq15yZ6prJ2pYrCwutOrpq%2BdoqjGcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./death-of-a-rising-star-selena.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>DEATH OF A RISING STAR: Selena</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./squid-game-the-challenge-reality-netflix-1235293943.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Squid Game: The Challenge Reality Series Greenlit at Netflix With Open Casting Call</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
