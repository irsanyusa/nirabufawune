The moments go by way too fast if it is only one day.</li><li>I forgot to wish you a happy special day. On the bright side, that gives us a reason to celebrate it all over again. We should even do it for an entire week or month.</li><li>It took me some time to believe that you are getting older. But then I thought, you are getting wiser too!</li><li>My wish may be late, but it is undoubtedly genuine. From the deepest part of my heart, I sincerely wish that you encounter love, happiness, and immense joy.</li><li>It is apparent that you have been blessed with many things on your special day. Unfortunately, a punctual message from me was not one of them. Hope you had a fantastic day!</li><li>I simply do not believe that you age at all. This makes it impossible to remember your birthday. I hope you had an amazing time.</li><li>Just when I felt my life was organized, I totally missed your special day! You are a great friend, and I feel terrible for my forgetfulness.
