Seacrest complimented Hough’s creativity, while Hough commented on whether or not Seacrest was a cuddler during their time together.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-seacrest-reunites-with-ex-girlfriend-julianne-hough>Ryan Seacrest Reunites with Ex-Girlfriend Julianne Hough</h2><p>Seacrest started his interview with Hough by complimenting her perfume. He added that it was “very nostalgic” to have her on the show, recalling “several conversations we’ve had on this very radio station.” In fact, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">former couple first met</a> when Hough was a guest on his show.</p><p>During the interview, Seacrest’s co-hosts, Sisanie Villaclara and Tanya Rad, asked Hough to confirm whether he was a “cuddler” during their relationship, since he has said he doesn’t cuddle. Hough admitted, “I don’t really remember.” Seacrest agreed, “I don’t either.”</p><p>They went on to talk about Hough’s new novel, which also has original music to go along with it. Seacrest was in awe as she spoke about the project, saying, “I know you’re creative, but I realize how un-creative we are … It’s very impressive.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Seacrest commented that Hough “can do everything,” to which she responded, “I had a very good mentor for quite so many years.” She seemed to be referring to Seacrest, who insisted he “can only do one thing.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JULIANNE HOUGH SAYS DATING RYAN SEACREST INSPIRED HER LOVE OF WINE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-did-the-two-of-them-break-up>Why Did the Two of Them Break Up?</h2><p>Seacrest and Hough are clearly on good terms after their breakup, which might make fans wonder why they ever split in the first place. Hough was recently a guest on Dax Shepard’s podcast Armchair Expert, where she talked about why she decided to end things with Seacrest.</p><p>Hough and Seacrest dated from 2010 to 2013. She revealed that she was worried it might look like she was dating Seacrest for fame, as he was an established TV host by that time. She added that she “overcompensated” because of this.</p><p>“The rug was swept up from underneath me, and I was just flying, and I was experiencing things that I didn’t even know existed,” Hough shared, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>. “But then I had this insecurity that I was like, I don’t ever want anybody to think that I’m with him for this reason.”</p><p>Hough went on to admit, “I don’t know if I’ve ever truly been in love with someone, but I have loved the feeling of being loved. And so let me be what that needs to be so that I can be loved.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Original_AGT_LiveShow1_results-220x147.jpg alt="Which ‘AGT’ Acts Are Moving on to the Semifinals?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>julianne hough</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>ryan seacrest</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570bKYp2Wjmq6kvsSsq2aqlaq7qsDErGSwoaSdeqbEjKCgq6SWp7amusNmoa6kmZa7r7GMoaaun5hivK950ZqboqddqLWww44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-pogues-shane-macgowan-dead-at-65.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Pogues' Frontman Shane MacGowan Dies at 65</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rare-succulents-resemble-mermaid-tails-and-its-so-mesmerizing-youll-want-to-buy-one-800444.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rare Succulents Resemble Mermaid Tails, and Its So Mesmerizing Youll Want to Buy One</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
