This was their last chance to prove themselves worthy of the AGT title, to be announced during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wednesday’s results show</a>.</strong></p><p>This year’s Finals features a rivalry <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">between two country acts</a>, as well as two magicians. We also saw some completely original acts like nothing we’ve seen before on the series. You can vote for your favorites on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NBC website</a> or the AGT app until 7 a.m. ET Wednesday.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-agt-finals-features-country-showdown>‘AGT’ Finals Features Country Showdown</h2><p>One of the most anticipated aspects of this season’s Finals was the showdown between country trio Chapel Hart and singer Drake Milligan. They both made some interesting choices during this week’s show, and now it’s up to America to decide if either of them should win the $1 million prize.</p><p>First, Chapel Hart went in a different direction from their first two performances by singing a patriotic tune called “American Pride.” Although Simon Cowell loved the message, he admitted that some of the vocals were off. Their hearts were clearly in it, but it wasn’t quite the same as what we’ve seen.</p><p>At the end of the night, Drake Milligan took the stage and made the interesting decision to once again sing his hit audition song, “Something I’d Do.” He definitely delivered on energy, earning a standing ovation from the judges. Heidi Klum even called him “the one to beat.” But was it fresh enough to earn votes from the viewers at home?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-two-magicians-go-head-to-head>Two Magicians Go Head to Head</h3><p>Another interesting matchup during Tuesday’s show was between magicians Nicolas Ribs and Yu Hojin. They both brought a heartfelt element to their performances, with Nicolas talking about family and Yu talking about dreams.</p><p>Nicolas brought one of his daughter’s drawings to life, blurring the line between art and reality. Klum called his act “a new kind of magic,” whereas Cowell shared his dislike for the music. He said it sounded like “an aunt playing piano after lunch,” earning boos from the audience.</p><p>Later in the episode, Yu took the stage and performed something similar, turning drawings into objects. However, the act had a unique conclusion, as he revealed that the objects he had stacked during the routine created a shadow reminiscent of the Statue of Liberty. He earned a standing ovation from the judges.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-are-the-mayyas-the-act-to-beat>Are The Mayyas the Act to Beat?</h3><p>After last week’s performance, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we expected The Mayyas</a> to bring something incredible to the stage for the Finals, and they delivered. They started off with a gorgeous tableau, creating a skirt of feathers which hid most of the dancers.</p><p>They went on to create a beautiful routine using handheld lights that had the judges on their feet and the crowd screaming. You could barely hear Sofia Vergara as she shared her thoughts. Howie Mandel told the group they’re his “favorite act ever on AGT.”</p><p>Will the Mayyas become the first dance group to win the show? Or will another act take the top prize? We also saw some unique performances from pole dancer Kristy Sellars and ventriloquist Celia Muñoz, as well as some laughs from Mike E. Winfield, amazing technology from Metaphysic, entertaining music from Avery Dixon, and impressive vocals from Sara James.</p><p>We’ll find out on Wednesday night who was chosen as the winner of Season 17. Tune in at 9 p.m. ET/PT to learn the results, and make sure to <a href=#>vote for your favorites</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_JohnLegend_JimmyFallonShow_Photo-by-Todd-OwyoungNBC.jpg alt="John Legend Explains Why He Chose to Release a Double Album" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZqqVmK6xecWipZqkmajBtHnPnqmfp6Kieqe70WajmqukYrCprc2cnGasn2KvpnnNmqSenF2osqK%2Fzqdkam9drLavusSrZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-plus-size-model-recreates-stars-iconic-desert-photoshoot.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Plus size model recreates star's iconic desert photoshoot</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./europacity-recoit-un-avis-defavorable-dans-le-cadre-de-lenquete-publique.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>EuropaCity reoit un avis dfavorable dans le cadre de l'enqute publique</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
