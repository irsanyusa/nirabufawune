So many people often ask “how old was Amanda Blake when she died?” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">It happened in 1989</a> when she was 60 years old.</p><p class=align-left>Amanda Blake death was a tragedy for many people. The star died in Mercy General Hospital in Sacramento, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the reason was AIDS</a> with related symptoms of liver failure and CMV hepatitis. As it is known AIDS can be transmitted through unprotected coitus, from mother to child or through blood injections (those who take drugs often become AIDS victims). Supposedly, Amanda got this terrible illness from her last <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">husband Mark Spaeth</a> as long as he died at the age of 45 from AIDS (just a year after their divorce). Later a city council member revealed the details about the marriage:</p>“They had been good friends for years. The general perception was that Amanda was sort of down and out, in some financial difficulty, and that was the reason for the marriage. Mark was fairly well-off. He was definitely perceived as being gay. Mark was accepted as being gay, and his close friends were known to be gay.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e030b093f2b80433.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Unveil the most exciting facts from the biography of Fiona Shaw</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Amanda Blake was not only a talented actress but also a kindhearted personality.
