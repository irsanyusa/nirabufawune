He tried different options to no avail until he asked a friend who then set him up.</p><p>He said, "When I was ready to marry and I wanted to meet someone, I was like, 'As a celebrity, how do you meet someone? How do you date?' I even tried dating apps but I didn’t find my ideal woman there. So, I was like, I would just ask people.</p><p>"I asked Audu Maikori and he was like, 'There's this girl called Eniola Mafe.' And I was like, 'Let's see.' As he was saying it, I pulled her up on Instagram. Now, when I was younger, I used to say the woman I wanted to marry had an Afro. I pulled up her DP and she had an Afro."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He went on to tell a story, which he had once told before, about how he was smitten when he came across her page, finding it hard to believe that a woman that smart and beautiful was single. Summoning the courage, he slid into her DM, and the rest they say, was history.</p><p>Abaga added, “I went on her page, I was like, 'Are you guys telling me that this woman is not married? Is it that she's divorced?' That was my first thought based on what I saw, how she looked, and the things she was into. You know, when you see that kind of opportunity, you sit up.</p><p>"So, I now hit her up. I followed her. The next day, she saw something on my story; she responded to it and we started chatting. As soon as we started talking, we never stopped talking. The next time we spoke, we spoke for two hours. The third time we spoke, we spoke for three hours."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Abaga successfully kept his relationship with Mafe private and out of the scrutiny of social media until he popped the question to her. He then announced their engagement in April 2022 stressing that he knew when he met her in December 2020 that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. <a href=# id=2cda2c66-90d3-4abb-909b-85bfb67e2638 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>The couple tied the knot</a> in 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGahp6ditm65xK1kprFdrLansYyrmKmolad6rrWMmpman5Fkg3R9xLKhbA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-holland-romeo-juliet-london-no-autographs-1236024376.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Inside Tom Hollands Teary, Blood-Soaked Romeo Thats Igniting Fan Frenzy on Londons We</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./face-la-deferlante-des-rancongiciels-la-reponse-des-pouvoirs-publics-sorganise.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Face la dferlante des ranongiciels, la rponse des pouvoirs publics sorganise</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
