Zhu,&nbsp;currently a university student in Shanghai, will be enrolling at Oregon State University to pursue a bachelor’s&nbsp;degree in business — a dream his parents have had since they started&nbsp;saving a $157,000 nest egg for his education. But like many Chinese students who don’t speak English fluently, Zhu&nbsp;might not have been accepted without a little help. The&nbsp;21-year-old hired an education agent in <a href=#>China</a> to clean up and&nbsp;“elaborate” on the essay he submitted as part of his application.&nbsp;“Actually, the agency helped my application to some extent,” he says.</p><p>Stories like Zhu’s&nbsp;are becoming increasingly common as the ranks of&nbsp;Chinese students going abroad for college continue to swell. Because&nbsp;many Chinese students have only basic knowledge of foreign&nbsp;universities and have trouble making sense of complicated&nbsp;applications, a huge industry of education agents has arisen in the&nbsp;country to help guide them — and, in some cases, to do whatever it takes&nbsp;to get them accepted. This has created a thorny ethical dilemma in the U.S. While many American <a href=#>schools</a> are elated by the influx of Chinese&nbsp;students as they’ve scrimped and saved to make ends meet in the&nbsp;economic downturn, some educators worry that the reliance of Chinese&nbsp;students on agents has led to some unintended — and troubling — consequences.</p><p>(<strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Why Are China’s Universities Losing Their Star Students?</a>)</p><p>Although Chinese students have been going to America to study for&nbsp;decades, their numbers have spiked dramatically in the past few years.&nbsp;In the 2010–11 school year, more than 157,000 Chinese students were&nbsp;<a href=#>enrolled</a>&nbsp;at institutions of higher learning in the U.S. — a 22% increase over the&nbsp;previous year and tops among all countries. (Second-place <a href=#>India</a> had&nbsp;just 104,000.) The largest increase has been among undergrads: China&nbsp;sent nearly 57,000 to the U.S. in 2010–11, up from 10,000 five years earlier. For the wealthy, an overseas education is becoming&nbsp;almost standard. A&nbsp;<a href=#>survey</a>&nbsp;conducted by China’s Hurun Report found that 85% of rich Chinese&nbsp;parents planned to send their kids abroad to study. The U.S. is their&nbsp;preferred destination, followed by the U.K. and Canada.</p><p>While there are a host of reasons for this explosion, money and&nbsp;prestige appear to be the most important factors. Not only can more&nbsp;Chinese families now afford to pay the tuition at a foreign university, they also view it as a better investment in their&nbsp;children’s future. Universities in the West are revered in China, and&nbsp;homegrown schools — even the best ones — fail to measure up. “I think the&nbsp;college education in China is not very practical,” says Vincent Sun,&nbsp;another Fudan student who will be enrolling at MIT this fall to pursue&nbsp;a master’s degree in finance. “When I will be searching for a job, I&nbsp;think a degree from a very famous [foreign] university is a huge thing&nbsp;I think that will put me into a very good place.” Ironically, a&nbsp;foreign university can also be a fallback for Chinese students who&nbsp;don’t do well enough on the national exam, the gaokao, to get into a&nbsp;Chinese school — there’s always an American college willing to take&nbsp;their tuition dollars.</p><p>But many of these students would probably never make it to America&nbsp;without a middleman to pave the way. According to a 2010 <a href=#>report</a>&nbsp;by Zinch China, a consultancy that advises U.S. colleges and&nbsp;universities on China, 8 out of every 10 Chinese undergraduate&nbsp;students use an agent to file their applications. And with such&nbsp;intense competition among agents — not to mention ambitious students and&nbsp;their overzealous parents — cheating is rampant, the group says. It&nbsp;estimates that 90% of recommendation letters from Chinese students are&nbsp;fake, 70% of college application essays are not written by the&nbsp;students, and half of all high school transcripts are falsified.&nbsp;“The world of higher education is becoming extremely competitive, much&nbsp;more so than it was even 10 years ago, and I think the kids are&nbsp;looking for an edge,” says Tom Melcher, chairman of Zinch China.&nbsp;“Everyone is looking around and saying, ‘Well, everyone else is&nbsp;cheating, why shouldn’t I?’”</p><p>(<strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>These Schools Mean Business</a>)</p><p>Another issue that concerns some admissions officers in the U.S. is&nbsp;where the money is coming from. Not only are agents paid by families&nbsp;in China — up to $10,000 before bonuses, according to Zinch — some&nbsp;American schools also have contracts with agents that guarantee them a&nbsp;commission for each student they enroll. This practice constitutes a&nbsp;potential conflict of interest, says Philip Ballinger, head of a&nbsp;commission launched by the Washington-based National Association for&nbsp;College Admission Counseling (NACAC) to study the issue of foreign&nbsp;recruiting. “If money is first, then perhaps the interest of student&nbsp;or the person that’s involved is not first,” he says.</p><p>What’s desperately needed is greater oversight in China and the&nbsp;U.S. — something both sides are now trying to address.&nbsp;The Chinese government realizes that doctored transcripts are a&nbsp;problem: earlier this year, it launched a new service to verify&nbsp;students’ high school grades for foreign universities.&nbsp;But because there are&nbsp;literally thousands of agents operating in China, cheating will persist. “The Chinese&nbsp;kids, when I talk to them, they sort of think it’s the schools’ fault.&nbsp;The schools will say you have to have a recommendation letter from a&nbsp;guidance counselor, and Chinese kids don’t have guidance counselors,”&nbsp;Melcher says. Zhu, the student enrolling at&nbsp;Oregon State, says his agent didn’t falsify documents&nbsp;beyond the “elaborated” essay, but he believes doing so is sometimes a&nbsp;necessary evil. “Some schools in China test students by very hard&nbsp;questions beyond their abilities, so the scores students get are very&nbsp;low. So the students who want to go to the USA, they had to change&nbsp;their scores,” he says. “But the students are still very good students&nbsp;because they’re in the best schools in Shanghai.”</p><p>In the U.S., there are hopes that the NACAC committee investigating&nbsp;overseas recruiting practices will bring much needed clarity to a&nbsp;situation that has been a relative free-for-all in recent years. While&nbsp;federal law prohibits colleges and universities from paying&nbsp;commissions to recruit students in the U.S., there is no statute against doing it internationally. NACAC has a policy against it, but&nbsp;enforcement has been put on hold while its investigation is&nbsp;continuing. The group’s second meeting is set for this fall;&nbsp;recommendations are expected to come in 2013.</p><p>(<strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Why Is College Enrollment Dropping?</a>)</p><p>Although it acknowledges that fraud is a major concern, NACAC is&nbsp;focusing initially on the question of whether universities should be&nbsp;permitted to pay overseas recruiters commissions. Mitch Leventhal, vice chancellor for global affairs at the&nbsp;State University of New York (SUNY)&nbsp;and an outspoken&nbsp;pro-recruiter advocate, argues that agents can provide a legitimate&nbsp;and useful service for foreign students, provided they operate in a&nbsp;professional and transparent way. He says it’s ridiculous to suggest&nbsp;that universities should stop using agents. “That’s sticking your head&nbsp;in a hole. They’re not going to go away because market demand is there, so the best way to address it is to engage them and identify the good&nbsp;ones.”</p><p>Leventhal believes he’s found a way to do that. He’s founder of an&nbsp;organization called the American International Recruitment Council,&nbsp;which has developed a rigorous process for certifying international&nbsp;agents. Agents must volunteer and pay a fee for the service, which&nbsp;involves a third-party investigation of their business, an external&nbsp;review by two members of U.S. universities and a confidential&nbsp;complaint system. So far, the group has certified about 45 agents, who&nbsp;benefit, Leventhal says, from having increased access to U.S. schools.&nbsp;And after agents are thoroughly vetted, he sees nothing wrong with&nbsp;paying them commissions, so long as the schools are also transparent&nbsp;about it. At SUNY, the fee is 10% of the student’s first-year tuition.&nbsp;“No one likes to pay a commission to a real estate broker when we buy&nbsp;a house because it’s another expense,” he says. “But we don’t deny the&nbsp;fact that a real estate broker works on commission and deserves to&nbsp;earn something for their effort.”</p><p>This sentiment isn’t shared by everyone. Mark Sklarow, head of the&nbsp;Washington-based Independent Educational Consultants Association (IECA),&nbsp;says students in China are better served by so-called educational&nbsp;consultants, who are paid solely by families (not by U.S.&nbsp;universities) to find the best educational match for students. Dozens&nbsp;of consultants in China have applied to become IECA members, but the&nbsp;organization must first ensure they’ve never accepted money from a&nbsp;college or university and they’ve never engaged in fraudulent&nbsp;practices. He believes that as Chinese students become more familiar with the U.S. application process, they’ll increasingly&nbsp;turn to consultants like these to help them make decisions about&nbsp;colleges rather than put all their trust in agents.</p><p>Sklarow says the U.S. is at a turning point too. For the past five&nbsp;years, colleges and universities were “balancing their budgets on&nbsp;Chinese students,” but he thinks the pressure is now on them to find a&nbsp;way to regulate the system. “I think until American colleges stand up&nbsp;and say we need a way to guarantee that the students we accept, that&nbsp;the records we’re looking at are whole, complete and legitimate, the&nbsp;problem continues to grow.”</p><p><strong>LIST:</strong> <a href=#>The 20 Colleges with the Most (and Least) Student Debt</a></p><p>* Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified David Zhu’s school.
