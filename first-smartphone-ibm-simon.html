It went on sale to the public on August 16, 1994 and packed a touchscreen, email capability and more, paving the way for our modern-day wondergadgets.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s a look at some of Simon’s history.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">IBM and BellSouth first showed Simon off in late 1992.</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It was code-named “Angler” and was unveiled at the fall COMDEX convention in Vegas, but wouldn’t be available to purchase by consumers until August 16, 1994. In 1995, the great Computer Chronicles TV show led its “Year of the Portable” episode with Simon.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s the brief segment:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I am totally computer-functional!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The phone had no web browser — heck, computers were just getting decent browsers back then — but email access was a big selling point. It could send faxes, too, which is a technology people haven’t been able to completely kill off yet despite decades of trying.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">It was big and expensive, but not insanely so.</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">By today’s standards, of course, Simon was clunky and outrageously priced. But for a do-it-all gizmo in the mid-’90s, its $1,100 price tag should elicit a mere shrug from most of us nowadays. And if you signed a two-year contract with BellSouth, you could get it for $900; that subsidized price eventually dropped to $600.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The phone itself measured 8 inches long by 2.5 inches wide by 1.5 inches thick, and weighed two ounces north of a pound. That’d be pretty clunky today, but we’re talking about the ’90s here. Everyone was wearing Hammer pants and Zubaz, so pocket space wasn’t much of an issue, right? As you can see in the above photo — where it’s placed next to an iPhone 4S — it’s big but not monstrous.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">It had a touchscreen and apps.</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Touchscreens weren’t exactly nonexistent back in the early ’90s, but they weren’t super common, either. Simon is believed to be the first commercially available phone with a touchscreen, though earlier PDA devices had showcased various portable touchscreen technologies. Simon’s interface could be navigated with an included stylus, and somewhat less easily with a finger.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">These were the early days of mobile touchscreens, mind you. Take a look at Simon’s interface in <a href=# rel=noopener>this fascinating TekGadg video</a> from 2011:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Best line: “I don’t think it does multi-touch, Winston.” That parting jab at Android was uncalled for, fellas.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There was no app store, of course, but the phone came preloaded with several apps. You can take a look at <a href=# rel=noopener>Simon’s user manual</a>, which is not only chock full of wonderfully nostalgic technobabble from back in the day, but also lists the following apps:</p><li>Address Book</li><li>Calculator</li><li>Calendar</li><li>Fax</li><li>Filer</li><li>Mail</li><li>Note Pad</li><li>Sketch Pad</li><li>Time</li><li>To Do</li><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">These things weren’t called “apps” back then. They were generally referred to as “features” found in the “Mobile Office” section of the phone. Here’s a look at the alarm clock:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Email was no picnic to set up, either. It used Lotus’ cc:Mail offering, which required you to dial in to a computer running cc:Mail software that housed all your messages — the “post office,” as it were. How would you set up this post office? You wouldn’t: According to Simon’s manual, “You don’t have to worry about how to set up a post office, because your E-mail administrator or service does that.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">It had predictive typing.</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The feature was called the “PredictaKey” keyboard and, according to the user manual, “always shows the six most-likely letters that you need, depending on the characters you’ve just typed.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">BellSouth had apparently also been working with Apple to develop a cellular connection for the Newton PDA at the time.</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An <a href=# rel=noopener>early profile of Simon</a> alludes to a BellSouth-Apple partnership for <a href=# rel=noopener>Apple’s Newton PDA</a> wherein BellSouth was “working with Apple to integrate cellular into the device.” The piece quoted BellSouth’s then-product-manager Rich Guidotti assuaging concerns that the two devices would compete:</p><figure class=text-left readability=28><p>BellSouth’s work with Apple is not affected by the new Simon, Guidotti said. Referring to the Newton as an electronic organizer and the Simon as a personal communicator, Guidotti added: “No one product fits everyone’s needs.”</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A cellular connection for the Newton wouldn’t materialize from the BellSouth-Apple partnership, however. Built-in cellular features for the Newton <a href=# rel=noopener>were apparently nixed altogether</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Simon made an appearance in The Net.</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The movie, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to Frank Costanza</a>, is “called The Net, with that girl from The Bus.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">You could plug it into a regular phone jack.</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though Simon was targeted at deep-pocketed business people, cell service was still spotty and expensive back in the mid-’90s. An optional cable allowed Simon’s owner to plug it into a standard phone jack (remember those?) to make calls via more reliable and less expensive land-line systems.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Simon lived fast and died young.</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite its features, IBM and BellSouth didn’t exactly have a hit on their hands. Simon spent a mere six months on the market, with around 50,000 units sold. <a href=# rel=noopener>Businessweek’s profile of the device</a> cites Simon’s weak battery — it lasted around an hour — and the cool factor of svelter and svelter flip phones as contributing to Simon’s demise. It sounds like IBM and BellSouth kind of lost interest in the project as well, with IBM in the middle of downsizing endeavors and BellSouth pumping resources into bolstering its cell network.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Simon, we hardly knew ye. But your ghost lingers on in our modern-day communicators.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Further Reading</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Microsoft’s Bill Buxton <a href=# rel=noopener>has a great info page</a> with links to a bunch of old Simon-related material.
