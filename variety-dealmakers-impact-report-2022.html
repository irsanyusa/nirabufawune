continues to move steadily closer to his still far-off goal of building the biggest media company in the world. In 2022, his Allen Media Group (AMG) bought the free ad-supported streaming service HBCUGO.TV, closed deals for it to carry Southwestern Athletic and Intercollegiate Athletic Conference games, then secured a TV distribution deal with CBS owned-and-operated duopoly stations. He also bought Black News Channel for $11 million, launched the streaming service Sports.TV and added eight Asian entertainment channels to AMG’s AVOD platforms Local Now, Sports.TV and theGrio.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Ahead of the curve with AVOD: </strong>“Everybody was asking consumers to pay this, pay that [for SVOD services],” he says. “We said, ‘Look, the world’s favorite word is free.’”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Lisa Alter, Katie Baron</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/lisa-alter-katie-baron.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Partners<br>Alter Kendrick & Baron</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Alter and Baron have handled over $3 billion in deals in the past 12 months alone. The duo repped Primary Wave Music Publishing in acquiring various interests in the music catalogs and master recordings of James Brown, Def Leppard, Stevie Nicks, Luther Vandross, Tom Whitlock, the Strokes, Regent Music Corp. and Jewel Music Publishing Co., America, Gerry Goffin, Chris Isaak, Patrick Leonard, Olivia Newton-John, Culture Club, Alice in Chains and many others.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Sound investments:</strong> “The music industry was the investment world’s best kept secret,” says Alter. “What’s changed in the past couple of years is that the mainstream investment world has caught on to the fact that this music and the income stream brought by music assets are very valuable, and that’s directly connected with the advent of streaming and the increase in streaming over the past several years.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Greg Akselrud</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Greg-Akselrud-Variety.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Partner; Chair, Internet, Digital Media & Entertainment Practice<br>Stubbs Alderton & Markiles</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In recent months, Akselrud has handled everything from financing for podcast company Crooked Media to GoDigital Media Group’s acquisition of outdoor apparel brand Eastern Mountain Sports and retailer Bob’s Stores. He was also active in the music space, working on the team that repped the estate of Leonard Cohen in the sale of the late songwriter’s catalog to Hipgnosis in March.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Celebrity branding gold rush:</strong> “Everyone has an entrepreneurial bug,” says Akselrud, who served as corporate counsel for a $7 million Series A funding round for digital influencer Emma Chamberlain’s Chamberlain Coffee brand, led by Blazar Capital in August. “They don’t want to be just a spokesperson, they want to participate in owning a business.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Tom Ara, David Markman, Richard Petretti, Katherine Imp</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dla-piper.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Ara: Partner; Global & US Co-Chair, Media, Sport & Entertainment</strong><br><strong>Markman: Partner & Co-Chair, Entertainment Transactions</strong><br><strong>Petretti: Partner</strong><br><strong>Imp: Associate</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>DLA Piper</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ara and Markman repped TikTok in March for streaming MTV original TV series “Becoming a Pop Star” with Pepsi as sponsor. Ara and Imp advised TikTok launching TikTok for Black Creatives, an incubator program with Charles King’s Macro. Ara advised an affiliate of ZASH Global Media & Entertainment acquiring digital advertising analytics outfit AdRizer in February, and Ara and Imp repped ZASH for a streaming and promotional partnership with event-promoter Insomniac for its Electric Daisy fest that included an NFT token drop. Ara repped South Korea’s Coupang Play for its streamed Tottenham Hotspur soccer match this summer and also a Coldplay streaming concert a year ago in the Asian nation. Markman advised Jeanie Buss and David McLane for all-female wrestling syndicated TV “WOW — Women of Wrestling” in August including worldwide distribution. The attorneys, based in Century City, advised Pfizer for a Marvel comics promotion to boost vaccine awareness. Petretti recently joined the team from Sidley Austin.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Tech rising:</strong> Ara notes that Hollywood is rattled by suddenly falling stock prices, crumbling earnings and business models being questioned, as tech media disrupts the content business. “The opportunity is for one or more new business models to arise, each of which, in my mind, will have a technological core component,” Ara says.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Francisco Arias, Adam Hime, Megan O’Brien, Yogita Puri</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fifth-season.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Arias: General Counsel, Head of Business & Legal Affairs<br>Hime: SVP, Business Affairs & Associate General Counsel, TV<br>O’Brien: SVP, Business Affairs & Associate General Counsel, Film<br>Puri: SVP, Business Affairs & Associate General Counsel, International TV</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Fifth Season</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The team at Fifth Season (formerly Endeavor Content) has been busy with more than rebranding. In January, Arias led the business and legal affairs team through a six-month process selling Endeavor Content’s scripted assets to South Korea’s CJ ENM for approximately $785 million; he currently serves on the post-merger integration team. On the TV side, Hime struck network license deals for Mahershala Ali’s series “The Plot” (Hulu/Onyx), Jason Momoa’s “Chief of War” (Apple TV+) and Florence Pugh’s “East of Eden” (Netflix). On the film side, O’Brien guided sales of “80 for Brady” to Paramount Pictures and “Book Club 2: The Next Chapter” to Focus Features. O’Brien set a studio record when her deals for 10 films produced and financed this year totaled about $152 million. Puri was involved in investment and distribution deals with Fifth Season’s international production partners, Blink49 Studios, Nordic Drama Queens, the Story Collective and Dreamchaser Studios.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Personal Importance: </strong>Arias says seeing “Chief of War” get made is important to him on several levels: “It’s amazing to see a series of this scope and ambition come to life. It’s also especially important for me as an Indigenous American to see a story about native people — in this case, Native Hawaiians — being produced on this scale. It’s a huge show and I’m proud we’re producing it.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jeff Bernstein, Darren Trattner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jackoway-austen.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Partners, Boardmembers</strong><br><strong>Jackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner & Klein</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The duo handled deals for A-listers with the personalized touch of a boutique firm. Trattner negotiated Karen Gillan’s deals for “Jumanji” and “Guardians of the Galaxy.” He also negotiated a writer, director and producer deal for James Gray for “Armageddon Time” as well as pacts for Amber Midthunder, breakout star of “Prey.” Bernstein negotiated Margot Robbie’s acting and producing deals for Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie.” Additionally, he negotiated for Robbie’s production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, securing a new first-look feature film producing deal with Indian Paintbrush.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Streamer woes: </strong>“It’s going to be interesting to see how the economics of streamers play out over the next few years,” says Bernstein. “In the beginning of the of the evolution of the streaming world, they were overpaying to attract the very best actors, directors and writers to their platforms. But now, so many of these streamers are suffering financially, and I think there will be a market correction.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Paul Bernstein, Ronn Davids, Max Wellman, Kristen Ruisi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/venable.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Bernstein: Chair, Entertainment Transactions<br>Davids: Co-Chair, West Coast Corporate Transactions<br>Wellman: Counsel&nbsp;<br>Ruisi: Partner</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Venable</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This team closed numerous deals across the media landscape. Bernstein repped media investor Jon Jashni in his role with 890 Fifth Avenue Partners, the media- and tech-focused special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that acquired BuzzFeed. Bernstein and Venable partner Nick Jacobus also repped Jesse Collins Entertainment in an outside minority investment from Fulwell 73. Davids repped Night Media/the Chernin Group in the formation of a new investment company, Night Capital, to acquire established consumer-facing companies led by top talent in a deal worth $100 million. Wellman represented Top Drawer Merch, a merchandising, technology and Web3 agency in connection with branding and partnership deals with Budweiser, Goldenvoice and Riot Games. Wellman also repped London Alley, a production company specializing in music videos, commercials and brand content in connection with a joint venture with a top beverage company. Ruisi handled trademark work for Unanimous Media, the production company of NBA superstar Stephen Curry.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Storyteller supremacy:</strong> “It’s not about the story,” says Bernstein. “It’s about the storyteller. If you’ve got an alcohol and you want to attach a celebrity to it, it’s not about how the alcohol tastes. It’s about the celebrity you’re touching and you’re creating your brand based on the storyteller.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Dan Black</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Black-Dan-GreenbergTraurig.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Vice-Chairman, Global Entertainment & Media Practice<br>Greenberg Traurig</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Black continued to demonstrate his dealmaking prowess in 2022: For example, Litmus Music, formed in late 2021 to acquire rights in music IP, recently completed a capital raise of $500 million with the Carlyle Group; as lead outside counsel Black is negotiating several acquisition agreements, including catalogs, masters and publishing. New client Golden State Warriors’ Golden State Entertainment, a content-creation company, retained Black as lead outside counsel to handle projects that include documentaries and music. Additionally, Steve Harvey Global retained Black as lead counsel on multiple TV and music initiatives, and toy/entertainment company Spin Master expanded Black’s role as lead outside counsel for its initiative to produce content based on its IP, which includes “Paw Patrol.” Black also negotiated employment agreements for senior media execs.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Less posturing, more deals:</strong> “During the pandemic there was this underlying sense of, let’s see if we could make a deal and let’s just focus on that,” says Black. “A lot of the posturing that used to take place is not taking place. It’s resulted in more deals being concluded.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Gordon Bobb, Lily Tillers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gordon-bobb-lily-tillers.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Partners<br>Del Shaw Moonves Tanaka Finkelstein Lezcano Bobb & Dang</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The team of Bobb and Tillers have a reputation for striking deals that elevate the status and earnings of their clients within the film and scripted TV business. Bobb negotiated overall pacts for writer-producers Monica Macer at MGM Television and Selwyn Seyfu Hinds at UCP, plus a starring role for Asante Black (“This Is Us”) in feature film “Story Ave,” directed by Aristotle Torres and produced by Jamie Foxx. Tillers built on long-time client Quinta Brunson’s (“Abbott Elementary”) recent success with an overall deal with Warner Bros. TV.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Retrenchment: </strong>“It’s a little disheartening to see … the retrenchment on some of the gains that were made in the last couple of years with respect to initiatives concerning equity and inclusion, which seem to be the first on the chopping block when the major media companies need to cut spending,” Bobb says. “That’s something we need to be cognizant of, and hold the media companies accountable for the pledges that they’ve made.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Lauren Boglivi, Wai Choy, Robert E. Freeman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/proskauer-rose.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Partners<br>Proskauer Rose</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This trio frequently collaborated on matters for clients that include Warner Bros. Discovery and TMRW Sports, the shop founded by Mike McCarley, Tiger Woods and Rory MacIlroy. This year they helped TMRW launch its tech-infused golf league TGL in conjunction with the PGA Tour and prepare for its inaugural season “tee-off ” in January 2024. Individually, Boglivi helped Hearst Health’s Homecare Homebase acquire CellTrak Technologies, and aided in restructuring Magnolia Network’s joint venture with Chip and Joanna Gaines that brought legacy Discovery programming to HBO Max. Choy was part of one of the biggest media and entertainment deals to date: the $43 billion pact that united the assets of Discovery and AT&T’s WarnerMedia into Warner Bros. Discovery. Freeman, who also advised on that deal, was involved in the Big Ten Conference’s historic media rights agreements with CBS, Fox, NBC and Peacock.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>New business model: </strong>“Media companies are scrambling to develop, launch and market streaming products, including both paid and advertiser-supported (or FAST) services, and competing for consumers’ attention,” Freeman says. “The challenge for those companies is replacing the declining revenues from the traditional linear side of the business and Proskauer is ‘in the room’ on some of the most important deals being cut in the industry, including for both existing and new video programming services and platforms.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Val Boreland</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Val-Boreland-NBCU.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>EVP, Entertainment Content Acquisitions<br>NBCUniversal Television and Streaming</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Boreland brought new content to the Peacock streamer — from Lionsgate’s John Wick prequel series, “The Continental,” to an output deal allowing Universal films to stream exclusively on Peacock shortly after their theatrical releases. She also acquired six original rom-coms for E!, secured cable rights for USA to run five seasons of “9-1-1” and added several high-profile properties to Peacock.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>FAST future:</strong> “People are really investing in FAST channels,” Boreland says. “It’s a linear channel experience, but in the streaming environment. Some- times people just want to lean back, put something on and let it play. And these channels are also curated … if you like wrestling, you could have a wrestling channel.

Merlin’s global vision resulted in an April deal with one of the leading South Korean streaming services, FLO. This came on the heels of a December 2021 agreement with African streamer Boomplay, which reaches more than 60 million monthly active users. While some deals remain embargoed, Merlin recently shared news of its Pinterest partnership that will bring Merlin’s hundreds of thousands of artists to the platform.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Not a zero sum game: </strong>“The narrative going back to the transformation to digital has been that downloads replaced CDs, then streaming replaced downloads,” says Lexton. “There was a sense that if someone built a business on the basis of downloads, streaming was going to cannibalize that.
