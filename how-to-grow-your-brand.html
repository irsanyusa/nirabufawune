This is why </span><b>audience growth is essential to overall brand growth</b><span>. One of the easiest ways to get out in front of a new base of customers is through social media marketing.</span></p><p><span>In today’s world, it’s very rare to meet someone who doesn’t use social media: According to a study conducted by Statista on </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>global social media usage</span></a><span>, as of 2022, the average daily social media usage of internet users worldwide amounted to 147 minutes per day.</span></p><p><span>Given the significant amount of time people spend online, failing to employ social media marketing campaigns and paid social media strategies represents a lost opportunity to expand the reach of your brand and achieve desired outcomes.</span></p><h3 id=social-media-platforms><strong>Develop your brand on social media platforms</strong></h3><p><span>Social media offers a vast and engaged audience that can be leveraged to promote your brand and reach new customers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>By creating a strong and consistent online presence, you can increase brand recognition and awareness, establish your brand as a thought leader in your industry and engage with your target audiences in real time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It’s important to carefully select the social media platforms that align with your target audience and business goals.

Users want to engage with your brand and the most successful brands have fun with that engagement.</span></p><p><span>According to a </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>study by Khoros</span></a><span> on the ways users communicate with brands on social media, 75% of Twitter users said they used the platform as a way to engage with brands. Meanwhile, 59% of Facebook users and 34% of Instagram users said the same.</span></p><p><span>The brands that achieve the most success on social media inspire connection, spark conversations and use humor to add a personal touch. </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>Twitter</span></a><span> even created a contest to decide which brand is considered the best on the platform. Users voted to choose their favorite brand based on the company’s tweets.</span></p><h3 id=influencer-marketing><strong><span><strong>Invest in influencer marketing</strong></span></strong></h3><p><span>When considering how to grow your brand, an effective strategy is to entice users through influencer marketing. This marketing tactic involves partnering with individuals who have a large and engaged following on social media to promote your brand to their followers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>By leveraging the influence of these individuals, you can reach a wider audience and establish brand trust. Partnering with these individuals will offer your brand credibility and establish a relationship in users’ minds between the influencer and your organization.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Visa, one of </span><a href=#><span>Morning Consult’s Most Trusted Brands</span></a><span> of 2022, recently </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>partnered</span></a><span> with Derrick Henry, a running back for the Tennessee Titans of the NFL in a video advertisement.

It’s also a fastest-growing brand for each generation except Gen Z — and that’s just because the shoes are already popular with young adults. Croc’s leaders attribute the company’s success to their turnaround plan, which began six years ago and focuses on key consumer audiences, capturing both trend-driven shoppers who attach to the brand’s collaborations and those that appreciate the core product.</span><span><br></span></li><li aria-level=1><b>Zelle</b><span>: Gen Xers and baby boomers have gravitated toward Zelle over other options as they increasingly adopt the usage of peer-to-peer payment networks. With strongholds in the market, Zelle’s differentiator is the ease and security it can provide for more hesitant, late adopters of peer-to-peer payment networks. The brand has leaned into its relationship with major banking institutions to provide older generations with a frictionless way to use its services.</span><span><br></span></li><li aria-level=1><b>Roku</b><span>: Roku is the fastest-growing brand among Gen Zers due to its low-cost streaming products and compelling, free ad-supported streaming TV service, The Roku Channel. Roku stands out in the marketplace because it offers the widest selection of streaming apps and is commonly the top-recommended hardware maker on streaming device purchasing guides.</span></li><li aria-level=1><b>DiGiorno</b>: The Nestlé-owned frozen pizza brand ranks as the third fastest-growing brand with millennials in <a href=#>Morning Consult’s Brand Intelligence</a> database — no small feat for a brand that was already achieving nearly 50% purchasing consideration at the beginning of the year. Frozen pizzas may cost more than other groceries that consumers could use to make meals from scratch, but when positioned against the pizza delivery market, DiGiorno provides value for financially strapped millennials.</li></ul><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/11/30105737/Morning-Consult-Brand-Intelligence-Ad-Desktop-Wide.png alt="Morning Consult Fastest Growing Brands 2022 report download" width=1800 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h2 id=brand-intelligence><strong>Support your brand growth strategy with Morning Consult’s Brand Intelligence</strong></h2><p><span>At this point, you’re probably feeling ready to conquer your brand growth goals — but you don’t have to do it alone.</span></p><p><b>Morning Consult can help provide real-time insights into what consumers think about your brand. </b><a href=#><span>Our brand-tracking platform</span></a><span> can help you improve overall brand health, track your campaign effectiveness and measure performance against industry competitors.</span></p><p><span>We survey tens of thousands of people across the globe every day to provide you with actionable insights into what consumers think, see and say about your brand.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxxfo5pb2ign6x6tbuMoKmor12uvLa%2BjJupmqaUZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./itv-live-audience-saturday-night-takeaway-coronavirus-1203533376.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>ITV Goes Ahead with Saturday Night Takeaway Studio Audience Amid Coronavirus Outbreak (E</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./get-in-gear-how-to-compete-or-at-least-dress-like-an-olympian.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Get in Gear: How to Compete (Or At Least Dress) Like an Olympian</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
