From Halloween’s Catholic and Celtic backgrounds to what the most popular Halloween costumes of 2021 are, we’re here to answer all your burning questions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is everything you need to know about Halloween, including how and why we celebrate it.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What is Halloween?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Halloween is typically celebrated as a secular holiday in the U.S. Many people celebrate Halloween by dressing up in costumes ranging from their favorite character in a movie, a pop culture reference or their favorite animal (more on that below). Some people, often children, will spend the evening hours of the holiday trick or treating for candy.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">When is Halloween?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Halloween falls on Oct. 31 each year. Halloween 2021 lands on a Sunday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This year, October also had a <a href=#>Friday the 13th,</a> which is considered by some to be unlucky, according to American folklore. While the history of how Friday the 13th came to be considered unlucky isn’t completely clear to some historians, others like Dr. Phil Steven, an anthropology professor at the University of Buffalo, believe it <a href=#>comes from the Last Supper</a>, where 13 people sat together.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Why do we celebrate Halloween?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The earliest origins of Halloween can be difficult to trace. Some, like Halloween expert and author Lesley Bannatyne, link the holiday to the Celtic celebration of Samhain. The day marked “the turning of the year,” noted Bannatyme, author of Halloween Nation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, others such as historian Nicholas Rogers, a professor at York University, say there are actually no traditions carried over from the festival.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The reason people think it’s related to Halloween is because when you go to look at Irish Folklore Commission of the 1940s, Samhain and Halloween and a number of other words are used interchangeably to describe the end of October,” Rogers said, adding that both celebrations have supernatural and magical elements associated with them.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Both Bannatyne and Rogers noted Halloween as we know it today has much more direct connections to the Christian holiday of All Saint’s Day, which ended up falling on Nov. 1, after a series of date changes.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What does trick or treat mean?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Halloween night, children can be heard saying “trick or treat” after ringing their neighbors’ doorbells in hopes of getting some candy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On All Saint’s Day, and other Christian holidays, people would go door to door giving prayers in exchange for treats, Rogers said. The practice became popular in America as an effort to stop vandalism and mischief. Bannatyne notes that in the 1940s, people tried hosting parties to discourage the mischief and when that didn’t work, homeowners began meeting children with their lights on and giving out candy or money. “It was a whole campaign on how to trick or treat,” Bannatyne said. “Then it caught on.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How old is too old to trick or treat?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s no specific cutoff age for trick-or-treating in most places, though <a href=# rel=noopener>Food & Wine </a><a href=# rel=noopener>notes</a> that some towns are actually making rules that give trick-or-treaters a cut-off age.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lizzie Post, co-president of the Emily Post Institute, which gives advice on etiquette, says the most important thing is ensuring that younger children are given the priority when trick-or-treating on Halloween. “You want to make sure younger kids are getting the chance and the opportunity, but I don’t want to discourage teens from enjoying this as long they’re behaving well,” Post told TIME.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What are the most popular Halloween costumes this year?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Movies are lending a lot of costume inspiration this year. Wonder Woman is the most-searched Halloween costume on Google followed by Suicide Squad‘s Harley Quinn, the super villain that appears in DC comics; a clown; and Disney heroine Moana. A Unicorn was the fifth-most searched Halloween costume on Google. The most popular couple’s costumes are Bonnie and Clyde, Beauty and the Beast, Forrest Gump and Jenny, Lilo and Stitch, and Tarzan and Jane, according to Google.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pennywise, the clown from Stephen King’s thriller IT, was listed as a top costume choice <a href=# rel=noopener>by Lyst and Pinterest</a> following the movie debut earlier this year (one of TIME’s <a href=#>best Halloween movies</a> of 2017). Television-inspired <a href=#>Stranger Things characters</a> were the second most popular, according to Lyst and Pinterest, and Beauty and the Beast characters were the third-most popular.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What is the most popular Halloween candy this year?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So far, the leading treat on Google’s searches is doughnuts. Doughnut chains<a href=# rel=noopener> Dunkin Donuts</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Krispy Kreme</a> recently unveiled Halloween-themed treats like a special Boston Scream doughnut at Dunkin and spider and mummy doughnuts at Krispy Kreme. Among the more traditional Halloween candy options, M&M’s are the second-most searched on Google followed by candy corn, candy bark and chocolate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Candy corn was also a favorite </a>in Idaho, New Mexico, Michigan, Alabama, South Carolina and Rhode Island, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>sales data from Candystore.com</a> from 2007 to 2016. But Skittles, Reese’s Cups and M&M’s made up the most popular candies across the country, selling millions of pounds annually, according to the data.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtcWdmgHV8jrCfmqxdnsButMClo6ivlZq7br3UnqqtoZ%2BjwHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carrie-underwood-showcases-her-stunning-updated-outfits-for-las-vegas-residency.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carrie Underwood Showcases Her Stunning Updated Outfits for Las Vegas Residency</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-weeknd-the-idol-cannes-film-festival-1235545870.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Weeknds HBO Series The Idol Eyes Cannes Film Festival Premiere (EXCLUSIVE)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
