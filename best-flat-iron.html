A Flat iron with rounded or beveled edges also acts as a curling iron.</p><h3>What size is the plate?</h3><p>Flat iron plate sizes range from mini to extra-wide. How to pick the best size? <a rel=nofollow href=#>Laurabeth Cabott</a>, who’s created red carpet looks for celebs like Brittany Mahomes, Cara Delevingne shares that you will get the same result with any plate size. However, she says, “depending on the density of your hair, you may want to consider a bigger plate size to cut down on style time. The only exception would be short hair. A baby straightener (smaller size) will help make it easier to manipulate and style your hair.”</p><p>Flat irons plate sizes also work with different hair types. Mini, small, or baby straighteners (a common find in beauty subscription boxes) all have half-inch plates made for fine or short hair. They can also be on thicker hair to create tight curls or small waves. Average-sized one-inch plates work on all hair types. Flat irons with a one and a half inch plate are designed for thick or textured hair.</p><h3>Pick a plate material to match hair type</h3><p>The most common plate materials are ceramic, titanium, and tourmaline.</p><p>Ceramic flat irons can be used on all hair types. They can be used on all hair types. Because they provide gentle heat, they can be used on fine, color-treated and damaged hair.</p><p>Titanium flat irons heat up quickly and are perfect for thick or coarse hair.</p><p>Tourmaline flat irons are flat irons that use both tourmaline and another material because the mineral is delicate. The mineral emits negative ions that reduce frizz, seal the hair cuticle and add shine to strands. This type of flat iron is great for hair that frizzes easily. It also works well with color-treated hair.</p><h2 id=ceramic-vs-tourmaline-vs-titanium-flat-irons>Ceramic vs. tourmaline vs. titanium flat irons</h2><p>The most popular materials for flat iron plates are ceramic, tourmaline, or titanium. Experts Veronica Devore and Sydney Isseks, both members of the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Beachwaver Co.</a> hair team, explained how each type works on hair. While all three plate types evenly distribute heat, ceramic plates are especially kind to damaged hair. Isseks says that it’s great for hair that “needs some extra protection.”</p><p>Titanium is a lightweight, durable metal that quickly heats up. While it works well with thick or coarse hair, Devore warns that it’s “too intense for fine, brittle, or damaged hair.”</p><p>Tourmaline is the most fragile of the three and is usually paired with other materials. This crushed crystal is loaded with negative ions. When heated, the ions help reduce frizz, and flyaways and add softness and shine to strands. Isseks says “it’s a great option for anyone who wants to flat iron their hair daily.” Because ions work as a protective agent, this type of flat iron works with all hair types.</p><h2 id=do-flat-irons-damage-hair>Do flat irons damage hair?</h2><p>Any heat tool, be it a blow dryer or a flat iron, has the potential to dry out hair. Cabbott suggests you “use a leave-in conditioner with heat protection after washing and conditioning hair.”</p><p>Jan Spagnuolo, creative director of the Rossano Ferretti Hair Spa at the Park Hyatt in New York City, recommends a few things to prevent damage, “it’s more about what you do before using the flat iron that counts. For those with curly, wavy, or frizzy hair, make sure to blow out hair in a straight style before using a flat iron…I also think it’s a great idea to seal hair with a high-shine gloss to further protect hair from the sun and heat damage.”</p><p>Celebrity stylist Kacey Welch adds, “If you have color or chemically treated hair it is crucial to be cautious with a flat iron. Using a lower heat setting can prevent color fading or damage. When working with a flat iron, Welch advises to “avoid prolonged contact in one spot to prevent overheating and potential damage. This goes for all hair types. Never go over the same section more than twice.”</p><p>Celebrity hairstylist and CHI haircare ambassador <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bradley Tuggle</a> says it’s best to use the lowest heat setting for fine hair, medium-low heat for textured hair, and medium-high heat for thicker, fuller hair.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How do flat irons work?</h3><p>Flat irons have heated elements, also known as plates. Once the plates are heated, clamp the iron on a small section of hair. Glide the flat iron down the hair until the ends. This is called a pass. As you move the iron down the hair, the heat from the compressed plates straightens the strands.</p><h3>How to clean flat irons</h3><p>Only clean a flat iron when it’s not in use. Make sure that it’s unplugged and cool. Gently wipe down the plates with a damp cloth or paper towel. To get rid of product buildup on the plate, use either a vinegar and water mixture or rubbing alcohol to dissolve it. Use a cotton pad or swab that’s been dipped into the liquid, and gently wipe the residue until it disappears. Don’t scrub, dig at, or push down hard on plates, as this may damage them. After cleaning, wipe the plates dry.</p><h3>What type of flat iron is the least damaging?</h3><p>Every expert we spoke with agreed that ceramic flat irons are the least damaging. Bartels points out that “ceramic plates use infrared technology and heat up from the inside out.” While ceramic plates may take longer to heat up than tourmaline or titanium plates, they can be used on any hair type without fear of drying out or frying hair.</p><h3>How long do flat irons last?</h3><p>Designed to withstand high heat and daily usage, a flat iron can last for 10 years or longer. When looking at a flat iron's price tag, if you compare the cost per use (especially if you’re using it daily), pricey flat irons are a bargain.</p><h3>How do you curl with a flat iron?</h3><p>To create waves or curls with a flat iron, use one whose edges are rounded or beveled edges. The thinner the plate, the tighter the wave or curl. To make a wave, after wrapping the hair around it, gently pull the flat iron downward and release it. For curls, wrap hair around the flat iron, hold it for a few seconds, and then slowly release it.</p><p>Tight curls call for a small (0.5-inch plate) flat iron that has rounded edges. For bigger curls, use a regular-sized (1-inch) plate. After heating up the flat iron, spray hair with a thermal protectant product. Then, divide the hair into two main sections: hair to be styled and hair that will be left alone. Further, divide the styling section into smaller sections. The size of the section determines the size of the curl. Use the flat iron as you normally would, but instead of gliding it straight down the hair, wrap the hair around the flat iron, hold it for a second or two, and then release.</p><p>To make tiny curls that start close to the root, place the flat iron near the root and wrap the hair. For curls or waves that start mid-length, that is where you’d place the flat iron.</p><p>After curling hair, spritz lightly with a styling hairspray to set the curls. When hair is cool, the curls can be manipulated into a style. Either by raking fingers through the curls to break them up or using a comb or round brush to move them.</p><h3>How do I use a flat iron?</h3><p>After you’ve sprayed hair with a thermal protectant, divide hair into multiple sections. Take down one section, and starting close to the root, you’ll place the hair in between the flat iron’s plates, clamp the plate down on the section, and then slowly glide the iron down the section until the ends. You may want to do a second pass on that section. Once the section has been straightened, pin it back up and then start on another section. Repeat until all the hair has been straightened. After unpinning the hair from the various sections, either comb or brush it through. You may want to add a drop of hair oil to seal in moisture and stop flyaways.</p><p>For short hair, use a thin flat iron close to the root and slowly glide it to the ends. A small flat iron with a rounded edge can be used to add waves to short hair.</p><h3>Can flat irons be used on wet or damp hair?</h3><p>Unless the flat iron is made specifically for wet or damp hair, the answer is no. Using a flat iron on wet or damp hair can lead to fried hair.</p><h3>How to prevent heat damage when using a flat iron?</h3><p>Incorporate thermal protectant products into the hair care routine. Start with a heat-protectant-based leave-in conditioner and use either a thermal protectant styling cream or spray before using a flat iron. By using a lower heat setting, there’s less of a chance that the flat iron will fry or melt hair. Only use a flat iron’s highest heat setting if hair is exceptionally thick or textured.</p><h3>What is the difference between a straightening brush and a flat iron?</h3><p>A straightening brush combines a blow dryer and a round brush into one tool. It cuts down on drying and styling time. It can be used to add waves or curls too. Flat irons are styling tools that can only be used on dry hair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1llqGutXnIq6anZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./8-celebrities-who-have-unique-physical-features-816106.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>8 Celebrities Who Have Unique Physical Features</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./congres-des-maires-zero-artificialisation-nette-une-mise-en-oeuvre-lourde-dinterrogations.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>une mise en uvre lourde d'interrogations</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
