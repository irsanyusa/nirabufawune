He fits into this role due to his eloquence in speech and his powerful orations.</p><p>This is believed to have been borrowed from his father, <strong>Paul Kagame</strong>, President of Rwanda, who is his role model. In fact, he posits that:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“I look at him not just as a father, but also as a man—the principles that he lives by. I’ve never seen someone as principled and to their word. Whatever stand he takes, he always follows that.”</p><p>Born <strong>Ivan Cyomoro Kagame</strong>, he schooled in one of the most prestigious schools in the United States after which his fascination with the army saw him admitted to the West Point Military College.</p><p>“I was intrigued by West Point. My father served in the army for about 30 years before he retired.</p><p>Growing up, I was always surrounded by the military. I thought it would be an awesome formative experience. It tests your limits,” he says.</p><p>Eventually, he went on to become among the 18 foreigners who excelled at the institution. His ability to draw people to him has enabled him to be actively involved in his father’s campaigns for re-election among other efforts.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>His desire seems to be on helping the people in facing common problems that bedevil the society. He solicits and provides aid in most areas of the country. He says that;</p><p>“There certainly is a place for aid. But the thing about aid is that it’s only there to sustain something that is already there. It’s not there to solve the problem.</p><p>We want to help and do something sustainable. You don’t want to just give people handouts, help them build their businesses.”</p><p>Ivan considers himself a capitalist and hence aims at doing well for the citizens of his native land. He aims at being the best at everything that he does a virtue. He says that;</p><p>“Your biggest asset is management. It doesn’t matter how good of a product you have if you can’t run the company then it doesn’t matter. We look for the entrepreneur that has the great idea and good work ethic.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He goes on to say that his relationship with his father is very tight as they get to talk on a daily basis on various topics including sports.</p><p>The whole idea behind his fame has been based on his humility where not many regard him as the ‘President’s son’ but just an ordinary person. In fact, he posits that not many knew his parentage.</p><p>His love for the continent is evident in the way he regards Africans especially the Rwandese.</p><p>This is a feature by EbonyLifeTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mpq%2Bhlah8qbHLpaaanqKesKJ5xKmgrKeUmnp4edGempqoXZ7DorqMpJigmZ2afK2uyp9wo20%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./le-corps-prefectoral-est-mort-vive-le-corps-des-administrateurs-de-letat.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Le corps prfectoral est mort, vive le corps des administrateurs de ltat</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./diy-recipes-enjoy-your-very-own-homemade-chocolate-chip-cookies-with-this-recipe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Enjoy your very own homemade Chocolate Chip Cookies with this recipe</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
