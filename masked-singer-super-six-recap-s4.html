It’s the Super Six: finally combining the best of Groups A, B, and C in one night. But that means we have a lot of performances and clues ahead of us!</strong></p><p>Tonight, each group’s top two will go head-to-head for spots in the Finale, leaving THREE celebrities to be revealed. Plus, the panelists are joined by guest Craig Robinson, who is the host of the new upcoming series <a href=#>The Masked Dancer</a>.</p><p>To kick off the night, the Super Six came together for a performance of <a href=#>“Take On Me” by A-ha</a>. This Semifinals group is stacked! I can’t believe three of them will be going home tonight. But that brings us to the main event! Everything starts with the Seahorse vs. Crocodile.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-seahorse>Who is The Seahorse?</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5dWWQiwxYg</p>The Seahorse performs “That’s What I Like” by Bruno Mars in The Masked Singer Super Six</figure><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Even as a young girl, Seahorse knew she wanted to sing. But she was just “so darn shy.” Now, she gets to show her inner diva! Seahorse mentions that she’s pretty sure she knows who the Crocodile is, and that’s why she’s so intimidated by him! So now, she’s adding choreography to compete. Her super clue was a telescope. Seahorse’s safe clue was a connection with Nick. She explained, “So Nick, this is wild. But even before this show, you were a great host to me!”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: In her most dynamic performance yet, Seahorse sang “That’s What I Like” by Bruno Mars. She showed off some new dance moves and those strong, consistent vocals we’ve gotten since she first took the stage. Seahorse is clearly talented and not new to singing! Her energy and range are unmatched, plus she added in some crazy runs this week.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Robin Thicke matched the voice and riffs to Tori Kelly, who Nicole connected clues to but did not agree with. Jenny thought it could be Kesha. Guest panelist Craig Robinson predicted Sia.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-crocodile>Who is The Crocodile?</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOZcSVXSJc</p>The Crocodile performs “I Don’t Want To Miss A Thing” by Aerosmith in The Masked Singer Super Six</figure><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Crocodile says he can finally try all the different genres of music under this mask. He says tonight’s song is “deeply personal” to him, because he’s doing it for his “croc-lings,” his kids. Crocodile claims that he loves them so much, he drives eight hours to see them after every show. His super clue was a pizza with a rat on it. Crocodile is connected to Craig Robinson, explaining “You’re one of my favorite actors and it’s so cool to be able to share the screen with you again.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Singing “I Don’t Want to Miss A Thing” by Aerosmith, this was truly a moment for Crocodile. You could hear his boy band tone, but he really knocked the cover out of the water. (See what I did there?) And some of those high notes were epic!</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Craig Robinson works through the clues, thinking about what professional singers he has been on screen with, settling on one of the Backstreet Boys. Based on the clue about having kids, he guesses AJ McLean or Howie D. But Jenny interjects to say that Nick Carter has kids too! Robin says from the rocker voice, he leans more toward AJ. Ken predicts Crocodile is Nick Lachey.</p><p>After their performances, the audience and super-fans voted and decided to send Crocodile to the Finale. That means Seahorse will be unmasked at the end of the episode. Up next, we have Mushroom vs. Jellyfish!</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-mushroom>Who Is The Mushroom?</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riW9EwVzm70</p>The Mushroom performs “Valerie” by Amy Winehouse in The Masked Singer Super Six</figure><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: In his clues, Mushroom said he came to share his message of unity during the pandemic. He lost someone close to him because of it, teaching him to “make the most of every moment.” Now, he’s facing the Jellyfish after she’s already beaten him. Mushroom’s super clue was an alarm clock that went from reading 6:00 to 3:00. He is connected to Robin, claiming “I love mixing it up with you again, because this is definitely not the first time we’ve connected.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Mushroom sang “Valerie” by Amy Winehouse and had a blast on the stage! He had some dance moves and played around with runs and high notes throughout. Mushroom just has such a smooth voice and even though it cracked at one point, he brought the showmanship. Then, he broke into BEAT-BOXING to cap it all off!</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Robin is sticking with his former guess of Jaden Smith. Jenny landed on Jordan Fisher as her prediction. Craig Robinson is also getting a Broadway vibe, guessing Leslie Odom, Jr. Ken thought Mushroom might be Keegan-Michael Key.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-jellyfish>Who Is The Jellyfish?</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gyq3DkUg8cY</p>The Jellyfish performs “Stay” by Rihanna in The Masked Singer Super Six</figure><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Jellyfish’s clues started with her explaining she “felt like a bit of a jellyfish out of water” at first. But she’s grown more sure of herself since then! She’s feeling at the top of her game now. Her super clue was an Eiffel Tower, which she showed off saying, “Bonjour, Paris!” In Jellyfish’s safe was a connection to Ken, she admits “We’ve never met, but I can’t say I didn’t try.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Slowing things down this week, Jellyfish sang “Stay” by Rihanna. She really has gained so much confidence since her first time taking the stage. It’s very apparent! But she has the voice to back it up. And that’s hard to do, especially on a slow ballad like this.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Ken thought this may be an Olympic gold medalist, specifically snowboarder Chloe Kim. Nicole originally got Charli XCX vibes, but changed her guess to Grimes. Robin connected the Eiffel Tower to the 2024 Olympics in Paris, predicting Gabby Douglas.</p><p>After another round of voting, the Mushroom advanced to the Finale! So Jellyfish will be the second celebrity to be unmasked tonight. That leaves us with Popcorn vs. Sun for the last spot!</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-popcorn>Who is The Popcorn?</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSDHF4OApKs</p>The Popcorn performs “Better Be Good To Me” by Tina Turner in The Masked Singer Super Six</figure><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Popcorn feels “so blessed to be here.” She can spread a message of positivity here! But it’s also been emotional for her, with all the comments from the panel. Popcorn is going to do what she’s been doing “since all these other creatures were in diapers.” Her super clue was a “STOP” sign. In the safe for Popcorn was a connection to Jenny. She explained by saying, “We’ve definitely talked before, but never about how we’re both published authors.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Though many people have guessed Popcorn could be Tina Turner, she’s now singing one of her songs! “Better Be Good To Me” was. a great choice for Popcorn. She has a similar tone to the icon and showed off impressive high notes. This diva’s still got it, even after “decades!”</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Based on their connection, Jenny thought it might be Mary Wilson or Taylor Dayne. Robin guessed Tina Turner or Bette Midler, with Nicole agreeing with the latter. Craig Robinson “stole” Jenny’s guess of Mary Wilson.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-sun>Who is The Sun?</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-5qRTeuX8w</p>The Sun performs “When The Party’s Over” by Billie Eilish in The Masked Singer Super Six</figure><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Sun feels like she’s 5 years old again, “back at dance competitions where I could just move and be free.” It’s also awaken the competitor inside of her! She says she has a “really hard time expressing [her] feelings,” but she’s not holding back. Sun’s super clue was her breathing fire onto one of the men in black! Her safe clue was a connection to Nicole, claiming, “Last time we met was in the bathroom.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: To close out the night, Sun brought the heat. She sang “When The Party’s Over” by Billie Eilish, starting acapella. WHAT AN INTRO! And she just kept it going into the chorus too. Sun has such a powerful and emotive voice. She’s my favorite to win it all and this performance only reaffirmed that!</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Nicole says she’s met a lot of people in the bathroom, but settled on LeAnn Rimes or Brandi Carlile. Ken predicted Kate Hudson. Craig went last, guessing Emilia Clarke based on the clues.</p><p>At the end of voting, Popcorn was eliminated, sending the Sun to the Finale!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-three-celebrity-reveals-in-the-masked-singer-super-six>THREE Celebrity Reveals in The&nbsp;Masked Singer&nbsp;Super Six</h2><p>Now it’s time for our favorite part of the night–the celebrity reveals! And tonight, we already had the three eliminated singers lined up.</p><p>First to be unmasked was the Popcorn Mask, who was revealed to be…</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>The Popcorn is revealed in The Masked Singer Super Six</figure><p><strong>Taylor Dayne</strong>!</p><p>Next was the Jellyfish, who the judges have been lost on all season. But when she took off her mask, it was…</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>The Jellyfish is revealed in The Masked Singer Super Six</figure><p><strong>Olympic gold medalist Chloe Kim!</strong></p><p>And finally, we’re sad to see her go, but the Seahorse had to be unmasked. She’s another one that’s stumped the judges for most of the season. But did any of them guess her true identity? It was…</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>The Seahorse is revealed in The Masked Singer Super Six</figure><p><strong>Tori Kelly!</strong></p><p>That last reveal hurt. I really thought Seahorse would make it to the very end! And having Tori Kelly be unmasked before the Finale is whack. Throughout the course of the night though, at least one panelist correctly predicted each celebrity. They’reg etting better at this!</p><p>Well, that leaves the Crocodile, Mushroom, and Sun in the Finale. But we still have two exciting weeks of The Masked Singer season 4 left. Next week is a special Holiday Singalong before the Finale in two weeks.
