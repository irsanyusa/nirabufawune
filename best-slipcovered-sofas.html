There’s a myriad of choices available no matter your favorite design aesthetic, budget, or fabric needs. We’ve sifted through the choices and put together this curated list of our favorite and best slipcovered sofas, so you can find the perfect fit for your home.</p><h2 id=what-to-look-for-in-a-slipcovered-sofa>What to look for in a slipcovered sofa</h2><p>Like shopping for the <a rel=alternate href=#>best mattresses</a> or really any major furniture purchase in your home, you should carefully consider which features and options are most important for your household and what will be the most functional. For slipcovered sofas, we recommend you choose one based on the following.</p><ul><li><strong>Size and shape:</strong> Carefully measure and make sure the sofa fits in your room. No matter how good it looks, if it doesn’t fit, it won’t function properly. The great thing about slipcovered sofas is they’re available in a variety of shapes and sizes, so you can find one that’ll fit your space perfectly.</li><li><strong>Fabric choice:</strong> Look for ones matching your lifestyle, whether it’s stain-resistant, easy to clean, machine washable (versus dry clean only) and make the selection based on this.</li><li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Double check the slipcover can be maintained in a way that fits your lifestyle and budget, such as machine washable versus dry clean. Also, check out the reviews and read comments from others about how easy it is to maintain.</li><li><strong>Style:</strong> Find a style suitable for your room, such as a relaxed look that fits in with a cottage, farmhouse, or casual decor. Or, you can choose something more tailored for a more classic or formal look.</li><li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Comfort is key too, since you’ll likely spend hours on your sofa. Not only does this refer to the material of the slipcover, but also the cushion material, such as down or memory foam.</li></ul><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-slipcovered-sofas>Our top picks for the best slipcovered sofas</h2><p>Here’s a list of our favorites and why each of these may make a smart addition to your home.</p><h3>Best splurge-worthy sofa: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Birch Lane Putney 2-Piece Slipcovered Sectional</a></h3><p>If your sofa is the star of the room, you may be looking for a show-stopper no matter what it costs.
