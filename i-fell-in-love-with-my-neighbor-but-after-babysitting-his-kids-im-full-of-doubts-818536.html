She wanted to&nbsp;know what our audience thinks about her complicated issue, and she was obviously prepared for being judged, too.</p><p>She opened her latter, saying, «So&nbsp;I’m 35, and 9&nbsp;months ago&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;very messy and painful breakup with my&nbsp;fiancé, so&nbsp;I moved in&nbsp;with one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends and her husband in&nbsp;a&nbsp;house we&nbsp;are all now renting together. It&nbsp;was then that&nbsp;I met my&nbsp;neighbor, who&nbsp;I will call Kevin. He&nbsp;helped&nbsp;us all move our stuff into the new house, and&nbsp;I fell in&nbsp;love with him at&nbsp;first sight. We&nbsp;live in&nbsp;the suburbs of&nbsp;a&nbsp;big city, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;both ended up&nbsp;taking the same <a href=# title=bus data-link=tag>bus</a> to&nbsp;work at&nbsp;the same time each day.»</p><p>The woman explained, «I&nbsp;knew Kevin had a&nbsp;wife and <a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a>. I&nbsp;was aware of&nbsp;it&nbsp;from the very beginning, but it&nbsp;never stopped&nbsp;me. Kevin talked about them very often and even showed me&nbsp;the photos of&nbsp;them on&nbsp;his lockscreen and&nbsp;I saw some <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> pics of&nbsp;Kevin and his wife in&nbsp;their joint account on&nbsp;Facebook. I&nbsp;didn’t mind it&nbsp;at&nbsp;all, the whole <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> initially started out as&nbsp;a&nbsp;very innocent, silly crush.»</p><p><h2>The woman didn’t keep her feelings to&nbsp;herself.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/baf/384/208a215d8b85d514f15d2ca6a6.jpg><p>The woman goes on&nbsp;with her story, explaining, «Kevin is&nbsp;a&nbsp;handsome and a&nbsp;funny and sweet guy. The first time we&nbsp;were together in&nbsp;the bus, he&nbsp;asked me&nbsp;about my&nbsp;job and life, and&nbsp;I saw he&nbsp;was genuinely interested in&nbsp;what&nbsp;I was saying. This is&nbsp;something my&nbsp;ex&nbsp;never did and is&nbsp;something we&nbsp;argued about a&nbsp;lot.<br>Kevin is&nbsp;always doing things for his kids, he&nbsp;brings them treats and other stuff, and he&nbsp;was staying on&nbsp;the phone with his small daughter the entire way to&nbsp;work because she needed a&nbsp;soothing talk before a&nbsp;school presentation. For&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was easy to&nbsp;imagine how lovely and attentive Kevin would be&nbsp;with me&nbsp;because he&nbsp;was like that with everyone else.»</p><p>The woman added, «I&nbsp;just knew that Kevin and&nbsp;I could easily become something more. I&nbsp;also found out shortly after&nbsp;I developed feelings for Kevin that his wife is&nbsp;a&nbsp;person&nbsp;I went to&nbsp;the same school with, and&nbsp;I was surprised because they are total opposites. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;funny, she is&nbsp;very dry, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;exciting, she is&nbsp;dull, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;intellectual person, but she is&nbsp;very smart. I&nbsp;just was sure that their personalities didn’t fit very well together at&nbsp;all, and&nbsp;I could easily see Kevin getting stuck in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship because he&nbsp;was just so&nbsp;nice.»</p><p><h2>Once, Kevin asked the woman for a&nbsp;favor and she agreed to&nbsp;help him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7fc/16e/fce13a5b9abd7885fdb6309889.jpg><p>The woman goes on&nbsp;with her story, and she is&nbsp;getting very emotional about how the things developed. She wrote, «One evening, Kevin knocked on&nbsp;my&nbsp;door and asked if&nbsp;I could watch his kids for a&nbsp;few hours. I&nbsp;agreed right away. He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;that his wife was in&nbsp;the hospital in&nbsp;another city, Kevin was super worried and decided to&nbsp;drive there to&nbsp;see her. They don’t have any relatives, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep an&nbsp;eye on&nbsp;their kids for a&nbsp;few hours while a&nbsp;family friend would drive several hours to&nbsp;watch the kids at&nbsp;night.»</p><p>And that was the moment when the issue came&nbsp;in. The woman revealed, «Kevin’s kids were an&nbsp;absolute nightmare. They have three girls, and the oldest was a&nbsp;typical bratty preteen with a&nbsp;complicated character. She was rude, she disrespected my&nbsp;authority, she was arguing with me&nbsp;about everything. I&nbsp;even heard her call me&nbsp;names under her breath a&nbsp;couple times.<br>The middle girl was very loud and wanted to&nbsp;play loud, messy games even when&nbsp;I told her not&nbsp;to. The youngest girl, however, was sweet and quiet on&nbsp;her own, but she quickly joined in&nbsp;with the drama that her sisters wanted to&nbsp;create.»</p><p>The woman added, «I&nbsp;finally agreed to&nbsp;play hide and seek with the younger girls and&nbsp;I ended up&nbsp;getting locked out of&nbsp;the house. When I&nbsp;went back and tried to&nbsp;convince the oldest girl to&nbsp;let me&nbsp;in&nbsp;through the back door, she pretended she didn’t hear me&nbsp;and just put her headphones&nbsp;on. Thankfully, Kevin’s family friend arrived a&nbsp;few minutes later and let me&nbsp;in, and then&nbsp;I went home.»</p><p><h2>The woman now has very mixed feelings about everything.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f6/3a8/5fcd3c5625b963fe6d73b7fbba.jpg><p>The woman concluded, «The incident with babysitting makes me&nbsp;really sad, because before that time&nbsp;I would often dream about being a&nbsp;stepmom to&nbsp;Kevin’s kids one day. Now I&nbsp;want nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with these horrible kids, but at&nbsp;the same time, this is&nbsp;another proof to&nbsp;me&nbsp;that Kevin and his wife are not happy because children from a&nbsp;happy family do&nbsp;not behave like this.»</p><p>The woman added, «I&nbsp;just want to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;relationship with Kevin now, but I&nbsp;do not know if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible because his kids and&nbsp;I would not get along at&nbsp;all. Their mother also could easily get them to&nbsp;hate&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;really love Kevin and&nbsp;I know that we&nbsp;could have a&nbsp;beautiful relationship. But the incident with his kids has really shaken&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;just wish&nbsp;I had someone to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;about this, but everyone in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life would simply judge&nbsp;me.»</p><p>And here’s yet another story about intricate relationships with <a href=#>neighbors</a>. A&nbsp;woman’s husband was secretly watching their new neighbor, and the woman sincerely thought that he&nbsp;fell for her. But the truth appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;far more complicated, and the woman learned a&nbsp;lesson from this incident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZussSlo2ahnmK5sMLEZq6irJhiurp5zZ6goKCSpL9urtStZJqepJq%2Fbq7Am7CsoaSptq%2BzjKGgrGWbnrG0ecimZJ%2BtnKF6sLKMnaaumqSoenl9l25qb2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mise-en-oeuvre-du-principe-de-participation-du-public-la-loi-est-publiee.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mise en oeuvre du principe de participation du public : la loi est publie</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./as-jennifer-love-hewitt-turns-44-she-admits-that-she-feels-insecure-about-aging-811630.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>As Jennifer Love Hewitt Turns 44, She Admits That She Feels Insecure About Aging</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
