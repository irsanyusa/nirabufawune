like a complication from anesthesia [given by <strong>Dr. Mario Diaz</strong>] that she was given during the birth of her son - If she had told him about that incident, he would have approached the procedure differently. <strong>Doctor Freiman</strong> is said to have a clean record and is a board certified plastic surgeon, according to the Florida Department of Health.</p><p>Following recent pictures which hit the web yesterday, <strong>Linda Perez</strong> was seen carried by her father<strong> Fernando Izquierdo</strong> because she can barely move her limbs after complications during her August 2013 breast augmentation surgery.</p><p>According to UK’s DailyMail, the teen now has to be under <strong>constant supervision</strong> as she has dropped to a <strong>skeletal weight</strong> and Doctors fear that the now-19-year-old may never recover. Her mother is however, holding out for a recovery, citing the fact that her being off of her feeding tube is a good sign. "I still have hope because she is alive and she's home," <strong>Mariela Diaz</strong> told&nbsp;<a href=# id=9c56577c-f5ab-57aa-88ed-a5f65fb17039>The Miami Herald</a>.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Linda’s breast augmentation surgery took place at <strong>The Coral Gables Cosmetic Center</strong> on August 2013 and she reportedly paid <strong>ONLY</strong> $2,800, which is believed to be about half of the normal price of the procedure. Her family were told that <strong>her heart stopped</strong> during the operation and she was 'effectively' <strong>dead</strong> when she was transported to hospital. She suffered <strong>brain and heart damage</strong> during the procedure.</p><p>Perez was admitted to <strong>Mercy Hospital</strong> following her procedure and her family's attorney, <strong>Mark Eiglarsh</strong>, says that finding out what went wrong will require litigation.</p><p>While <strong>Dr Freiman</strong> has a clean history with the medical board, it later emerged that the anaesthetist <strong>Dr. Mario Alberto Diaz</strong> had previously served time for <strong>illegally selling pain pills </strong>over the internet. Dr Diaz served time in <strong>federal prison</strong> in 2006 for illegally dispensing at least 53,000 doses of pain pills over the Internet. He also had his Florida medical license suspended for six months</p><p>"They put a spinal aesthetic, and she needed to be intubated," <strong>Dr Freiman</strong> said in a report filed by the medical center to gain access to her [Linda] earlier records. He says that the information was purposefully kept from him in order to keep him from calling off the <strong>plastic surgery.</strong></p><p>While she may be remaining upbeat, Linda’s mother admitted that she has not come to terms with her inability to move on her own and says, "She goes into depression and cry, she sees that she cannot walk, and when she realizes what happened to her, she weeps."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Guys, please share with us your thought on this.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02iZq52RqMFutcypo5qmpGK1sL7RqKlmrJWau6KzxKtknJmeYq%2BivsSlsGaln6uybrvRZqqpnZGgeqKy056pZp6RobmqusZmoKesn2KwsLnAZqCnZ2Vur7myl6w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aider-un-proche-age-domicile-une-charge-plus-lourde-quil-y-parait.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>une charge plus lourde qu'il y parat</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./collection-post.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Simpler Composting | TIME</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
