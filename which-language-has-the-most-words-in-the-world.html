For instance, how many words does the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish language</a>&nbsp;have and how does it compare to French? We will solve the mystery about what language has the most words.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>According to the dictionary…</h2><p>Your first thought in finding out how many words exist in a language might be to simply pick up a dictionary. In that case:</p><ul><li>Based on the Oxford English Dictionary,&nbsp;<strong>the English language has over 200,000 words</strong></li><li>There are about&nbsp;<strong>145,000 German words</strong>&nbsp;in the Duden</li><li>The Diccionario de la Real Academia&nbsp;<strong>Española lists about 88,000 words</strong></li><li>Larousse lists around&nbsp;<strong>130,000 words in the French language</strong></li></ul><p>In other words, if we strictly pay attention to the number of words in a dictionary, we can safely say that English has the largest vocabulary. But does a dictionary really contain every word in a language? For instance, most dictionaries don’t include<a href=#>&nbsp;slang words</a>. Plus, for languages that allow words to be combined in different ways, dictionaries would never be able to include every word in the language. For example, the Duden doesn’t include entries for compound words, which are commonplace for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German speakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What makes a word?</h3><p>Clearly, it takes more than a dictionary to count the number of words in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">language</a>. But how do you begin to count the words in a language?</p><p>In German, it might make sense to count each&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">compound noun</a>&nbsp;as a word. But does this work as well in other languages? (Think of the word “up-to-date” in English.)</p><p>Some languages, like Spanish, use a lot of inflections compared to English. For example, should the words “talk”, “talks”, and “talked” be counted as separate words? What about “hablo”, “hablas”, “habla”, and “hablan”?</p><p>Let’s not forget about agglutinative languages like Finnish or Turkish, either. Agglutinative languages create new words by combining prefixes or suffixes together. In other words, like German, they can be combined in an infinite number of ways.</p><p>There are also languages that rely on characters to create meaning, such as Chinese and Japanese. The combination of different characters creates new meanings.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>List of languages with the most words</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>English</h3><p>English is an international language used in many different countries. It’s also a language that has incorporated thousands of words from other languages so that they’re commonly used among&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">native English speakers.</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Arabic</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arabic</a>&nbsp;words are made up of three, four, or five letter roots. These roots can create a great number of different meanings. If you were to count each variation as a separate word, you could come up with a very high number of words (even if not all of them are used by native speakers).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>German</h3><p>If you count compound words, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German language</a>&nbsp;can actually include over 300,000 words. So, in theory, German speakers could probably create as many words as they like.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Finnish</h3><p>As an agglutinative language, Finnish has the potential to create a potentially infinite number of words. Though, you certainly won’t find such a large dictionary.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What language has the least number of words?</h2><p>No matter how much you debate over which language has the most number of words, it’s easy to see that all of these languages are complex in their own way. But what about the language with the least number of words? The world’s smallest language is known as Toki Pona. It was created by a linguist and has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">only 123 words</a>. Surprisingly, that doesn’t mean it can’t be used to express almost anything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Cassie Wright</h2><p>Cassie Wright is a freelance writer and blogger living in the United States. After a bad experience with elementary school Spanish classes, she fell in love with learning French. Now, in addition to French, she spends a considerable amount of time learning Japanese and has jumped back into learning Spanish. Like many avid language learners, she plans to continue learning more languages than she has hours in the day. When she isn’t writing or learning, she loves reading, traveling, video games, and all forms of chocolate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57waWmoGeVo3y4tMicn2akkaO0tq3GnmShmaNiwamxjKamrKxdrLyzsNJmoKdlpJ2ybsPOq6OdZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./first-smartphone-ibm-simon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>First Smartphone: Fun Facts About Simon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1462867-veondre-mitchells-biography-age-height-parents-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ve'ondre Mitchell's biography: age, height, parents, net worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
