Far from it though, this heart-filling and emotional story is about getting through the challenges that life throws your way as they will come with turns and twists. What's interesting is that the story is told through the eyes of a golden retriever that is reminiscing towards the end of his life, Enzo the dog. The story is that of a man, the author, who crashed while enjoying his favourite hobby of racing with his best companion, a dog, nearby.</p><h3>How does the book compare to the movie - story summary</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9200edb579055dd0.jpg><p class=align-left>While The Art of Racing in the Rain movie may have slight variations to fit the movie industry, the heart of the story is not lost through it all, just as the author desired.

He has dreams that would see him become a pro racing driver someday.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3a4f76ff7fd3fbc7.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ghostbusters: Afterlife: All the interesting news about the anticipated movie</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He goes on to adopt Enzo, the dog whom he names after Enzo the Ferarri.
