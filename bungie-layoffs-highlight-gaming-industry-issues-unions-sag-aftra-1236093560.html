He summarized “rising costs of development and industry shifts” and “enduring economic conditions” as the reason.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This follows an earlier round of layoffs <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>last November</a> that saw Bungie cut around 100 jobs, which preceded <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>2024’s cascade</a> of more than 11,000 layoffs across the gaming sector — an amount that outpaced last year’s cuts in more than double the time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The original developers of the first “Halo” games for Microsoft’s Xbox consoles, Bungie has a complex history of operating both independently and under large corporations. After going independent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Microsoft</a> in 2007, Bungie eventually moved on from “Halo” to “Destiny,” a live-service franchise that was published exclusively by Activision until Bungie acquired the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>publishing rights</a> in 2019.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Then in January 2022, Microsoft and Sony announced deals to acquire <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision Blizzard</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a>, respectively.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The deals differed immensely in size, but each was driven by a desire to strengthen live-service strategy at either console giant through lucrative microtransactions, as well as bringing in expertise to, in Bungie’s case, advise on live-service projects at other studios.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Alongside its continuing work on expansions for “Destiny,” Bungie had several other projects in various stages of development that were of interest to PlayStation, but such rapid expansion amid industry-wide slowdowns in capital investment, lower ad spend and diminished release slates this year has made it difficult for even the biggest live-service brands to sustain themselves.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As popular as “Destiny” is, it’s not part of the big five online games that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rake in billions</a> of dollars each year, some of which operate as multimedia platforms unto themselves: “Roblox,” “Fortnite,” “Minecraft,” “Call of Duty” and “Grand Theft Auto.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Furthermore, the corporations presiding over such brands are among the biggest contributors to layoffs over the last year, particularly after pricey acquisitions. Take-Two Interactive’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>$12.7 billion acquisition</a> of mobile giant Zynga was meant to flush the company with more in-game spending to support “Grand Theft Auto 6” and other big projects, but the company cut 600 roles as recently as April, its third round of layoffs in the span of the year.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After that, the company wrote down <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly $3 billion</a> in losses for the first quarter of 2024 that were mostly related to “goodwill” expenses incurred from its M&A strategy.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Microsoft Gaming’s post-M&A reality has been even messier. “Minecraft” was already part of its first-party portfolio before the Activision deal, but the latter brought No. 1 console franchise “Call of Duty” into the fold. The earnings difference is notable; in its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest financial quarter</a>, Microsoft attributed 58 points of a 61% increase in Xbox content and services revenue to the net impact of acquiring Activision.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Yet mere months after that $69 billion deal closed, Microsoft <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cut 1,900 roles</a>, most of which were across Activision’s three publishers, including Blizzard and King. Later in May, its earlier acquisition ZeniMax faced layoffs as well, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">full studio closures</a> at publisher Bethesda.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As much as corporations justify cost-cutting as a practical solution to survive market hurdles, pronounced responses from their labor forces become inevitable.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In July, “Starfield” developer Bethesda Game Studios <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>formed</a> a “wall-to-wall" union that encompassed all roles at the studio, taking a cue from QA testers at ZeniMax who unionized in 2023. Days later, Blizzard saw more than 500 employees who work in various capacities on online game “World of Warcraft” unionize, becoming the largest such union at Microsoft Gaming, which inherited the union for “Call of Duty” studio <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Raven Software</a> when the Activision Blizzard deal closed. The newest unions formed with the assistance of the Communication Workers of America.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Hollywood’s side of the labor force has also joined the action. SAG-AFTRA, which participated in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>dual strike </a>with the WGA last year against the AMPTP and represents many actors who contribute their voices and likenesses to games, declared a walkout against major video game publishers in late July.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Like the Hollywood strikes, companies using AI as potential shortcuts to paying voice actors is a major point of concern, as are contracts that seek to retain an actor’s likeness in perpetuity for games.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">SAG-AFTRA members <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>picketed outside</a> the Warner Bros. lot Thursday in Burbank, where Warner Bros. Games is located. “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,” a big WB Games release in February that was heavily criticized for its live-service elements, was a financial disaster to which Warner Bros. Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels attributed a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>$200 million loss</a> in the gaming division.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “Suicide Squad” game was made by Rocksteady, a studio otherwise known for its acclaimed, single-player “Batman: Arkham” games. Similarly, the Arkane Austin studio that Microsoft Gaming closed as part of the Bethesda layoffs was responsible for <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>live-service failure</a> “Redfall,” the first game of that sort at Arkane’s studios after making well-received games such as “Dishonored.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For as much as the global video games industry is worth — analytics firms typically pin it at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">around $200 billion</a> — the disconnect between the corporations running the show and its revolving door of a labor force finding job security in short supply continues to undermine the industry’s efforts to get back on solid footing as AAA costs soar.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Grand Theft Auto 6,” which is targeting a fall 2025 release after more than a decade spent in development and a rumored <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$2 billion budget</a>, will undoubtedly see sales surge at Take-Two Interactive.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">But as multiple Microsoft studios have shown in recent weeks, the developers making such a mammoth game might have something to say about it — and their colleagues cut from the team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BrtrF7wa6loKGVYrmixc6fnaxlmJ60qbjIoJ%2BtZZeWuqq6xmagp5ylqMGzxYyiqqytlah6trrIqKWsZaOWtG6txa2pmmVhZ4B3fJhsbG9oXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-williams-oscars-star-wars-steven-spielberg-collaborations-1235929403.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Williams Reflects on Oscar Noms, 'Star Wars,' Spielberg Collabs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mexican-sayings.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>8 Mexican sayings to better understand the culture</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./aliens-abducted-my-parents-and-now-i-feel-kinda-left-out-trailer-jake-van-wagoners-exclusive-1235496708.html>Emma Tremblay Discovers an Out-of-this-World Secret in Aliens Abducted My Parents and Now I</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-much-money-does-bret-michaels-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Bret Michaels Make?
